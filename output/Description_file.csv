109,Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA),"


GLA is found in the seeds and oils of a range of plants including Onagraceae (evening primrose), Saxifragaceae (borage), and Rubaceae (blackcurrant). The richest source of GLA is borage (Borago officinalis).
What is Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) used for?
Overview
Fatty acids are the basic building blocks for all lipids. They consist of chains of carbon and hydrogen with an end acid group. Fatty acids vary in length and degree of saturation and generally are up to 26 carbons long. The polyunsaturated fatty acids contain more than 1 double bond. The double bonds are at carbon 3 (n-3) or 6 (n-6). GLA falls into the latter family, known as omega-6 fatty acids.
The actual location of the double bond significantly affects metabolism of the fatty acid, such that the structure and function of omega-3 derived eicosanoids differ from those derived from the omega-6 fatty acids (eg, arachidonic acid). For example, omega-3 derived eicosanoids tend to decrease blood clotting and inflammatory responses. This contrasts significantly with the arachidonic acid (omega-6) derived eicosanoids, which increase clotting and inflammatory responses.
Unsaturated fatty acids are essential components of cell membranes and can influence receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and signal transduction pathways. They can influence numerous inflammatory and immunological processes.
Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
The evening primrose plant is native to North America and was introduced into Europe in the 17th century. Native Americans consumed the leaves, roots, and seedpods as food and prepared extracts of the oil for use as a painkiller and asthma treatment. Some of these early therapeutic effects are thought to be because of GLA, which is found in high quantities in the oil.
In the 1930s and 1940s, several investigators found dietary supplementation with essential fatty acids such as GLA to be of therapeutic value in atopic dermatitis (AD). The advent of topical glucocorticoids brought an end to this form of treatment. However, by the early 1980s, there was a return to using these agents because of the unwanted side effects of glucocorticoids, and they have regained scientific interest. Over the last 2 decades, numerous other indications have been proposed for GLA.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Clinical studies using GLA (evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, blackcurrant seed oil) suggest a potential relief of pain, morning stiffness, and joint tenderness in rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. Benefits appeared to be increased when dosages were greater than 1.4 g/day of GLA, and administered for at least 6 months.
Cardiovascular protection
The apparent low death rate from coronary heart disease among Eskimos has focused interest on the potential benefits of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A small clinical study showed benefits in lowering total cholesterol and LDL, and raising HDL cholesterol. These effects suggest that GLA may contribute to cardiovascular protection. However, this is still an area of controversy.
Diabetes mellitus
GLA has been studied as for its possible benefits for diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic patients have abnormalities of essential fatty acid metabolism, and therefore require higher amounts of essential fatty acids. Studies have shown that the development of cataracts, retinopathy, and cardiovascular damage can all be slowed by the administration of large daily doses of essential fatty acid. Clinical studies have demonstrated consistent and progressive improvement of neuropathies when treated with GLA.
Atopic diseases/Asthma/Psoriasis
GLA has been shown in clinical studies to reduce itching, redness, and toughness of atopic skin. GLA also reduces the inflammation and overall severity of atopic dermatitis, while atopic disease in children often presents as bronchial asthma later in life. However, there have been no animal or clinical studies regarding the use of GLA for atopic bronchial asthma. Although psoriasis does not have an atopic component, the use of GLA has been investigated clinically with inconsistent results.
Other uses
GLA supplementation has been shown to increase lymphocytes, a key component in immune response. It also has been proposed that GLA may play important roles in cancer treatment. Small clinical studies have shown some improvement in immunologic status with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer and bladder cancer. Clinical studies have shown that GLA is effective in relieving PMS symptoms, including breast pain.
What is the dosage of Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA)?
GLA has been studied clinically for a wide variety of conditions, including asthma, dermatitis, and arthritis. Oral doses in trials have ranged from as little as 0.5 to 3 g per day.
Is Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) safe?
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/nursing
Not to be used by pregnant women and nursing mothers unless recommended by a physician.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No serious adverse effects have been noted.
Toxicities
Research reveals little or no information regarding toxicology with the use of this product.

What is Hibiscus used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
The hibiscus has had a lengthy history of use in Africa and neighboring tropical countries. Its fragrant flowers have been used in sachets and perfumes. In areas of northern Nigeria, this plant has been used to treat constipation. Fiber from H. sabdariffa has been used to fashion rope as a jute substitute. The fleshy red calyx is used in the preparation of jams, jellies, and cold and warm teas and drinks. The leaves have been used like spinach. The plant is used widely in Egypt for the treatment of cardiac and nerve diseases and has been described as a diuretic. In Iran, drinking sour tea for the treatment of hypertension is a popular practice. It has been used in the treatment of cancers. Research reveals little or no evidence of these medicinal uses of hibiscus. The mucilaginous leaves are used as a topical emollient in Africa. In Western countries, hibiscus flowers often are found as components of herbal tea mixtures. In Thailand, people consume roselle juice to quench thirst. Karkade seed products (ie, karkade defatted flour, protein concentrate, protein isolate) have been studied for their nutritional and functional value.
Hypertension
A randomized clinical trial evaluated the effect of sour tea available commercially in Iran on essential hypertension in otherwise healthy volunteers. A decrease in blood pressure was seen. However, after cessation of drinking the sour tea, a rise in blood pressure occurred. Although no adverse effects were seen in this study, the use of sour tea for treating hypertension requires further study.
Antibacterial/Vermifuge
Aqueous extracts of hibiscus appear to exert a slight antibacterial effect. In laboratory and animal studies, worms were killed by hibiscus extracts. Research reveals little or no clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as an antibacterial or vermifuge (kill worms).
Chemopreventive effects
Components of hibiscus have shown potential as a chemopreventative agent against tumor promotion in laboratory and animal studies. These components also possess anti-inflammatory properties. Research reveals little or no clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as a chemopreventive agent.
Laxative effects
The plant has been used as a mild laxative. While animal studies show a mild cathartic effect, research reveals little or no human clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as a laxative.
Other uses
Hibiscus has been studied for its use in preventing renal stone formation, as well as its respiratory and sedative effects. To date there is no clinical evidence to prove any of these beneficial medical effects. Additionally, hibiscus anthocyanins have shown antioxidant activity in protecting against hepatotoxicity in rats. Application and action in humans has yet to be investigated.
What is the dosage of Hibiscus?
There is no clinical evidence on which dosage recommendations can be based. Roselle has generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status as a foodstuff. A typical dose as a tea is 1.5 g.
Is Hibiscus safe?
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/nursing
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use. Roselle has emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) effects.
Interactions
Hibiscus beverages may reduce chloroquine plasma levels, decreasing the effectiveness.
Side Effects
No data.
Toxicities
The flowers are considered relatively nontoxic. However, high doses have caused death in mice within 24 hours.

151,L-arginine,"


Eggs, meats, milk, soy proteins, peanuts, and walnuts are all sources of arginine. The physiologically active form, L-arginine, is obtained by breaking down proteins. Arginine also may be synthesized in the laboratory. Because L-arginine may be synthesized in the body, it is classified as a nonessential amino acid in adults. However, in children and in people with certain conditions (eg, infection, trauma), L-arginine synthesis may become compromised and then may be considered semi-essential.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesL-arginine is a nonessential amino acid that may play an important role in the treatment of heart disease due to its block arterial plaque buildup, blood clots, platelet clumping, and to increase blood flow through the coronary artery. L-arginine is commonly sold as a health supplement claiming to improve vascular health and treat erectile dysfunction in men. L-arginine, which is promoted as a human growth stimulant, has also been used in bodybuilding. In the 1800s, it was first isolated from animal horn.
What is the recommended dosage?
L-arginine has been studied at oral doses of 6 to 30 g/day for a variety of conditions. Many formulations have been used.
Contraindications
Absolute contraindications have not been identified. L-arginine is not recommended in patients following an acute heart attack.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Specific information regarding safety and efficacy during pregnancy and breast-feeding is lacking, although several trials have been conducted in pregnant women without notable ill effects.
Interactions
L-arginine has unpredictable effects on insulin and cholesterol-lowering agents. L-arginine may increase the effects of isosorbide mononitrate and other nitric oxide donors, such as glyceryl trinitrate and sodium nitroprusside.
Side Effects
L-arginine has few reported adverse reactions. Nausea and diarrhea have been reported infrequently. Bitter taste may occur with higher doses. Due to its ability to dilate blood vessels, low blood pressure may occur. Intravenous preparations containing L-arginine hydrochloride have a high chloride content that may increase the risk for metabolic acidosis in patients with electrolyte imbalances. Low potassium and high serum urea nitrogen levels may occur in patients with kidney and/or liver impairment.
Toxicology
High concentrations of nitric oxide, which can be produced by L-arginine, are considered toxic to brain tissue.

The root of the plant is used for medicinal purposes. This root has a pleasant fragrance and spicy sweet taste, and has been used as a natural flavoring agent in medicines, foods, and non-alcoholic beverages. It should not be confused with the sassafras tree, which has the distinctive flavoring of American root beer.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
The French physician Nicholas Monardes described using sarsaparilla to treat syphilis in 1574. In 1812, Portuguese soldiers suffering from syphilis recovered faster if sarsaparilla was taken to treat the disease instead of mercury, the standard treatment at the time. Sarsaparilla has been used by many cultures for other ailments as well, including skin problems, arthritis, fever, digestive disorders, leprosy, and cancer. Late 15th century accounts explaining the identification and the first descriptions of American drugs include sarsaparilla. Sarsaparilla's role as a medicinal plant in American and European remedies in the 16th century also is evident.
Sarsaparilla has been used for treating syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) throughout the world for 40 years. It has been used for psoriasis, and was documented as an adjuvant for leprosy treatment in 1959.
Miscellaneous uses
The ability of sarsaparilla to bind to endotoxins may be a possible mechanism of action as to how the plant exerts its effects. Problems associated with high endotoxin levels circulating in the blood stream such as liver disease, psoriasis, fevers, and inflammatory processes, all seem to improve with sarsaparilla. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sarsaparilla for anti-inflammatory effects. A recent review addresses smilax compounds present in bodybuilding supplements said to “enhance performance.” Results of the study of more than 600 commercially available supplements determined that there was no research to validate these claims.
What is the recommended dosage?
Typical doses of sarsaparilla for a variety of uses range from 0.3 to 2 g/day of the powdered root.
How safe is it?
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/nursing
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No major contraindications, warnings, or side effects have been documented. Avoid excessive ingestion. In unusually high doses, the plant may be harmful, including GI irritation.
Toxicities
Research reveals little or no information regarding toxicology with the use of sarsaparilla.

218,Sassafras,"


Sassafras is the name applied to 3 species of trees, 2 native to eastern Asia and 1 native to eastern North America. Fossils show that sassafras once was widespread in Europe, North America, and Greenland. All parts of the tree are strongly aromatic. The drug is from the peeled root of the plant (root bark). Synonyms are S. officinale and S. variifolium."

221,Scullcap,"


Scullcap (S. laterifolia), a member of the mint family, is native to the US where it grows in moist woods. Although it is widely distributed throughout large regions of North America, there are related species found as far away as China. Scullcap is an erect perennial with bluish flower. Official compendia (eg, NF VI) recognized only the dried overground portion of the plant as useful; however, some herbal texts listed all parts as medicinal. A number of species have been used medicinally, and the most common European variety has been S. baicalensis, a native of East Asia."
222,Seaweed,"


Seaweeds are marine algae, saltwater-dwelling, simple plants, including red, brown, and green algae. Most algae have root-like structures called holdfasts that anchor the plant to rocks and other substrates. While blue-green species are called algae, they are actually bacteria."

SLO is commercially produced from several species of deep sea sharks' livers. SLO is a major natural source of squalene, a natural organic compound, and alkyglycerols, compounds that may fight cancer."
227,Slippery Elm,"


The slippery elm tree is native to eastern Canada and eastern and central US, where it is found most commonly in the Appalachian mountains. The trunk is reddish brown with gray-white bark on the branches. In the spring, dark brown floral buds appear and open into small, clustered flowers at the branch tips. White elm (U. americana) is a related species used in a similar manner."
228,SOD,"


Superoxide dismutase (SOD, orgotein) is an ubiquitous enzyme that has received attention because of its therapeutic activity and because of claims that its ingestion may improve health and lengthen the human lifespan. At least 3 distinct types of the enzyme are found in humans and other mammals.A highly reactive superoxide free radical is generated as a toxic metabolite in a wide range of normal biological reactions that reduce oxygen. Since the superoxide radical is toxic to normal living cells, the enzyme superoxide dismutase, which is present in all cells, catalyzes the conversion of superoxide to the harmless components oxygen and hydrogen peroxide."

245,Vinpocetine,
246,Vitamin E,"


Vitamin E is a generic term for a group of tocol and tocotrienol derivatives. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that exists in a variety of forms in many foods (eg, spinach, nuts, sunflower seeds, olives, asparagus, vegetable oils, mangoes, wheat germ, whole-wheat breads). The most common form in a Western diet is alpha-tocopherol. The most important chemical characteristic is its antioxidant property, which in foods, blocks the addition of oxygen to fats, causing rancidity. In the body, antioxidants may prevent formation of reactive oxygen species, which can cause damage to proteins and DNA in tissues."
247,Walnut,"


There are about 15 species of Juglans (walnut genus); commercially, J. regia is the most important. This deciduous tree can grow to 45 m in height. J. regia is native to Asia but is cultivated now in France and other parts of Europe, North Africa, North America, and East Asia."

254,Yerba Santa,"


The yerba santa plant is an evergreen aromatic shrub that is indigenous to the hills and mountains of California, Oregon, and northern Mexico. It often is cultivated as an ornamental shrub. The hairy, lance-shaped leaves are glutinous, and its flowers are white to lavender in color."
255,Yogurt,"


Yogurt is the general term for a fermented, slightly acidic milk product that contains essentially no alcohol. Most commonly, it is prepared by the addition of live cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus to heated whole or skim cow's milk. The mixture is incubated and homogenized to a semisolid. Condensed skim milk or dry milk solids sometimes are added to produce a custard-like texture. If cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus are added, the product is called acidophilus milk. Yogurt provides a dietary source of calcium and protein, as well as folic acid, magnesium, and zinc.
What is it used for?
ProbioticYogurt has been promoted to restore the GI flora after systemic antibiotic therapy and to alleviate anal pruritus, aphthous ulcers, and canker sores. The large number of bacteria in active yogurt (each milliliter of commercial brands contains about 125 million L. bulgaricus and 125 million S. thermophilus) may hasten colonization in the colon, thereby removing the reservoir of yeast infection. More than 3 decades ago, bacterial replacement therapy with live cultures was found to have no established value in the prevention or treatment of such disorders. Yogurt possesses intrinsic antibacterial activity, probably largely because of its lactic acid content. Lactic acid has demonstrated bactericidal activity against some organisms, but this is probably not the only factor in eliminating the bacteria.Cardiovascular and cholesterol reduction effectsFat loss and weight loss have been demonstrated with the use of yogurt. Enhanced calcium intake was proposed as the mechanism for this effect. Older studies have demonstrated a cholesterol-lowering effect with yogurt. Surveys suggest yogurt has a protective effect against coronary heart disease and elevated blood pressure.OsteoporosisOne human clinical study showed that the addition of yogurt to the diet significantly reduced a marker of bone resorption in menopausal women. Despite the debate that exists regarding the role of supplemental calcium in the prevention of osteoporosis, yogurt remains a recommended source of calcium.Anticancer effectsYogurt also may have some anticancer properties. Yogurt has a protective effect against some cancers in laboratory experiments, but convincing human data are not available.Other usesYogurt has been used as a substitute for milk for those who are lactose intolerant. Yogurt has been at the center of a controversy regarding milk products that can be tolerated by people with lactase deficiency. Studies are inconclusive. Reports by those with lactose intolerance and other bowel disorders indicate individual responses that often vary from study results.Yogurt also has been used to prevent recurring vaginal yeast infections. There has been some interest in the direct vaginal instillation of yogurt for the treatment of Candida infections. However, the clinical effects of this therapy have not been defined in well-controlled studies, and this practice cannot be widely recommended, particularly in pregnant women.
What is the recommended dosage?
In addition to its widespread use as a food, yogurt has been studied in clinical trials in amounts of 100 to 200 g/day.
Contraindications
The use of yogurt containing live cultures (probiotic) is not advised in patients at risk for opportunistic infections or in those with badly damaged GI tracts.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Generally recognized as safe when used as food.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Yogurt is not associated with any significant adverse reactions.
Toxicology
No data.

257,Yucca,"


The name yucca applies to as many as 40 species of trees and shrubs found mostly in arid portions of North America. The common names noted above can apply to different species. The Spanish bayonet is Y. aloifolia and Our Lord's candle is Y. whipplei. Other common yuccas include Y. schidigera (Mohave yucca) and Y. brevifolia (Joshua tree), which grows to 60 feet in height and commonly is found at the bases of desert mountains. Yucca plants are characterized by stiff, evergreen, sword-shaped leaves crowded on a stout trunk. There is a dense terminal flowerhead faintly resembling a candle. The flowers are white or greenish. All yucca plants depend for pollination on nocturnal yucca moths. Each variety of moth is adapted to a single species of yucca."
