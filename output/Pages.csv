2,Acerola,"
Acerola
What is Acerola?



Acerola (previously M. punicifolia) is native to the West Indies. It also is found in northern South America, Central America, Texas, and Florida. This small shrub or tree has 5-petaled flowers ranging from pink to white in color. Acerola fruit is a bright red cherry-like fruit containing several small seeds. Mature fruits are soft and pleasant tasting. They contain 80 percent juice. The fruits deteriorate rapidly once removed from the tree.
Scientific Name(s)
Malpighia glabra, M. emarginata
Common Name(s)
Acerola also is known as Barbados cherry, West Indian cherry, Puerto Rican cherry, Antilles cherry, cereso, cereza, cerisier, and semeruco.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAcerola is believed to originate from the yucatan. Traditionally, the fruits have been used to treat dysentery, diarrhea, and liver disorders. Other ethnobotanical uses include as an astringent and for fever.Vitamin supplementationBoth species of Malpighia have been reported to be excellent sources of vitamin C. However, the fruit of M. emarginata is known more accurately as acerola and is one of the richest sources of vitamin C. Acerola is used as a source of food and juice. Because of its high concentration of vitamin C, it also is sold as a natural health supplement. Acerola provides other useful vitamins and minerals. Acerola contains from 1 to 4.5 percent vitamin C (1,000 to 4,500 mg/100 g) in the edible portion of the fruit. This far exceeds the content of vitamin C in peeled oranges (about 0.05 or 50 mg/100 g). The content of vitamin C in acerola varies with ripeness (highest in green and lowest in fully ripened fruit). It also varies with the season and climate. Vitamin C analysis regarding acerola storage finds freezing the fruits to be the best way to preserve vitamin C, as compared with room temperature or refrigeration. In addition, acerola contains vitamin A (4,300 to 12,500 IU/100 g) at about the same level as in carrots. Other constituents include thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, and bioflavonoids. It also contains phosphorus, malic acid, pantothenic acid, potassium, and magnesium. The sugars dextrose, fructose, and sucrose are also present. Acerola analysis in another report finds protein, fiber, lipids, and fatty acids. Zinc and other minerals are present, as well. Vitamin C is an essential coenzyme that is required for normal metabolic function. Many animals can synthesize vitamin C from glucose; however, humans must obtain the vitamin totally from dietary sources. Deficiencies of this water-soluble vitamin result in scurvy. This is a potentially fatal disease with multisystem involvement. Dietary supplements have traditionally provided adequate protection against the development of this disease. However, controversy has focused on whether vitamin C derived from ""natural"" sources is more physiologic than that produced synthetically or semisynthetically (as ascorbic acid). To date, there is no clear evidence that naturally derived vitamin C is superior in its clinical effectiveness than synthetic ascorbic acid. There is a potential advantage to using acerola as a source of vitamin C. The advantage is that one receives not only ascorbic acid but also several other useful vitamins and minerals from the fruit. Whether this is superior to the use of a multiple vitamin preparation has not been determined. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of acerola for vitamin supplementation.AntioxidantVitamin C is known to strengthen the immune system and build collagen cells. It also supports the respiratory system. Vitamin C is known to be an effective antioxidant. The antioxidative qualities of acerola make it an ideal ingredient in skin care products to fight cellular aging. In another report, acerola extract was shown to enhance the antioxidant activity of soy and alfalfa extracts, acting synergistically. This may be beneficial in coronary artery disease.Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of acerola as an antioxidant.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no clinical evidence to guide human dosage of acerola.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Large doses may produce GI distress. Prolonged, massive dosage may predispose to formation of renal calculi.
Toxicology
Vitamin C is readily excreted by the body and is not typically associated with toxicity.

4,Acidophilus,"
Acidophilus
Scientific names: Lactobacillus acidophilus
Efficacy-safety rating:
ÒÒ...Ethno or other evidence of efficacy.
Safety rating:
●...No safety concerns despite wide use.
What is it used for?



Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
For several decades, health and nutritional benefits have been claimed for products containing Lactobacillus cultures. The topical or intravaginal application of yogurt products has been reported to control yeast and bacterial infections.
Replenish normal bacterial flora
L. acidophilus has been referred to as a probiotic, defined as microorganisms that have a beneficial effect on the host by improving the properties of the indigenous microflora. Products containing live cultures have been investigated for their ability to compete with pathogens in the microenvironment, thereby permitting the reestablishment of normal bacterial flora. Lactobacillus has long been considered to be a component of the protective flora in the vagina. Recently, Lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide have been found in normal vaginal flora. Consequently, the therapeutic benefits of Lactobacillus products have been investigated in women with vaginal and urinary tract infections. Its value in treating lower urinary tract infections remains unclear. Acidophilus has also been used to treat sore mouth caused by Candida infections. While some clinical studies are positive, more studies are needed to determine the exact therapeutic benefits of acidophilus.
GI uses
L. acidophilus is normally found in the human alimentary tract. Consequently, the oral administration of products containing L. acidophilus may be useful in the management of a variety of conditions associated with altered GI flora. Their beneficial effects may be related to the ability to suppress the growth of pathogens. Acidophilus also has been reported by laboratory findings to suppress the growth of C. pylori, implicated in acid-peptic disease. More clinical trials are necessary to validate these findings. The ingestion of yogurt products has been associated with decreases in the concentration of several fecal enzymes that have the capacity to convert procarcinogens to carginogens in the colon. This suggests that the consumption of Lactobacillus-containing products may have beneficial effects, although no further data are available to support this hypothesis.
Antibiotic-induced diarrhea
The ingestion of Lactobacillus preparations has been recommended to reduce the symptoms of antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Some clinical studies show that Lactobacillus-containing products help reduce the incidence of diarrhea, nausea, cramping, flatulence, and yeast superinfection with patients on antibiotics. Yet to date, no consensus has been reached regarding the effectiveness for this use. Acidophilus did not prevent travelers diarrhea in another clinical study.
Cholesterol control
Other reports have indicated that the ingestion of acidophilus-containing products can reduce serum cholesterol levels. Acidophilus bacteria have the ability to assimilate cholesterol. However, conflicting results of clinical trials remain concerning Lactobacillus species-effect on serum cholesterol levels.
Lactose intolerance
Acidophilus milk has been used to treat patients with lactose intolerance, although controversy remains regarding its effectiveness on lactose digestion.
What is the recommended dosage?
Similar to yogurt, used as a food.
How safe is it?
Contraindications
Complete avoidance of L. acidophilus in children with short-bowel syndrome may help prevent episodes of D-lactic acidosis.
Pregnancy/nursing
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
L. acidophilus is generally considered safe, as it is normally found in the human alimentary tract. However, in patients with abnormal heart valves who have recently experienced dental manipulation, endocarditis caused by Lactobacillus species has been reported.
Toxicities
No data.

5,Aconite,"
Aconite
What is Aconite?



These perennial plants grow to a height of 0.6 to 1.5 m and resemble delphiniums. Aconite has characteristic helmet-shaped blue or purple flowers. Occasionally, the flowers may be white, pink, peach, or yellow. More than 100 species of Aconitum are found throughout the temperate zones of the United States and Canada. These plants also are found throughout many parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. They contain poisonous alkaloids such as aconitine.
Scientific Name(s)
Aconitum napellus L., Aconitum carmichaelii Debeaux, and Aconitum kusnezoffii Rchb. Family: Ranunculaceae (buttercups).
Common Name(s)
Aconite tuber, monkshood, friar's cap, helmet flower, soldier's cap, wolfsbane, devil's helmet, blue rocket, leopard's bane, chuanwu, caowu, wutou, futzu, and bushi.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesVarious species of Aconitum have been used for centuries both as poisons and medicines. The root is the most toxic plant part, although all parts are considered to be toxic. Extracts of Aconitum species have been given orally in traditional medicine to reduce fever associated with colds, pneumonia, laryngitis, croup, and asthma; for pain, inflammation, and high blood pressure; as a diuretic; to cause sweating; to slow heart rate; and for sedation. In traditional Asian medicine, root extracts are typically mixed with licorice or ginger. Extracts also have been used as arrow poisons. Historically, aconite was most commonly used in Western cultures as a tincture. It was applied topically as a counterirritant liniment for neuralgia, rheumatism, and sciatica. In homeopathy, aconite is used to treat fear, anxiety, and restlessness; acute sudden fever; symptoms from exposure to dry, cold weather or very hot weather; tingling, coldness, and numbness; influenza or colds with congestion; and heavy, pulsating headaches.
What is the recommended dosage?
Extreme caution is required. Fresh aconite is extremely toxic, and safe dosage is dependent on processing. Many species are used medicinally in China only after processing. Traditional Western texts recommended 60 mg of the root per dose.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. In addition to oral administration, external application is reported to cause toxic symptoms. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No data.
Toxicology
Aconitine is highly toxic. As little as 2 mg of pure aconite or 1 g of plant may cause death from paralysis of the respiratory center or cardiac muscle. Clinically important toxicity may develop following percutaneous absorption; even slight contact with the flowers can cause fingers to become numb.

Angelica
What is Angelica?



Angelica is a widely cultivated, scented, northern European herb with fleshy, spindle-shaped roots, an erect stalk, and many greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbrella-like shape. The seeds are oblong and off-white. It is similar to and sometimes confused with the extremely toxic water hemlock, Cicuta maculata. There are several recognized varieties of A. archangelica, wild and cultivated. In the US, Angelica atropurpurea often is cultivated in place of the European species. The oil has been used medicinally to stimulate gastric secretion and treat gas, and to topically treat rheumatic and skin disorders. The Ayurvedic medical system suggests angelica for CNS effects. Angelica root, root powder, essential oil, and liquid extracts made from the herb are prepared and used traditionally.
Scientific Name(s)
Angelica archangelica, synonymous with Archangelica officinalis.
Common Name(s)
Angelica also is known as European angelica, Echt engelwurz (German), Garden Angelica, Holy Ghost, Wild Celery, Norwegian angelica, Chorak (Indian) 
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAngelica has been cultivated as a medicinal and flavoring plant in Scandinavian countries since the 12th century and in England since the 16th century. Angelica formerly was used as a sedative. The roots and seeds are used to distill a volatile oil used in perfumery and for a licorice flavoring in liqueurs and other alcoholic beverages. The candied leaves and stems are used to decorate cakes.General usesAngelica may have applications in treating epilepsy and anxiety; however, clinical trials are lacking to support therapeutic applications. Antioxidant activity has also been reported.
What is the recommended dosage?
Angelica root typically is given at doses of 3 to 6 g/day of the crude root, but clinical trials are lacking regarding dosage recommendations.
Contraindications
Crude fruit extract is not recommended; safety and efficacy have not been established.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Documented adverse effects. Emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) effects.
Interactions
Angelica sinensis may prevent blood clots.
Side Effects
Limited clinical trials provide information on adverse effects. A small clinical trial found no increase in blood pressure or heart rate during 8 weeks of leaf extract use. Skin allergies have been reported, and a sensitivity to light is possible.
Toxicology
Poisoning has been reported with high doses of angelica oils.

What is Anise?



Anise is an annual herb that grows 0.3 to 0.6 m and is cultivated widely throughout the world. The flowers are yellow, compound umbels and its leaves are feather shaped. The greenish-brown, ridged seeds are used for food or the drug. They are harvested when ripe in autumn. Aniseed has an anethole-like odor and a sweet ""licorice-like"" aromatic taste, which has led to the traditional use of anise oils in licorice candy.
Scientific Name(s)
Pimpinella anisumIn some texts, anise is referred to as Anisum vulgare or A. officinarum. Do not confuse with the ""Chinese star anise"" (Illicium verum).
Common Name(s)
Anise also is known as aniseed, and sweet cumin.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAnise has a history of use as a spice and fragrance. It has been cultivated in Egypt for at least 4,000 years. Recordings of its diuretic use and treatment of digestive problems and toothache are seen in medical texts from this era. In ancient Greek history, writings explain how anise helps breathing, relieves pain, provokes urine, and eases thirst. The oil has been used commercially since the 1800s. The fragrance is used in food, soap, creams, and perfumes. Anise often is added to licorice candy or used as a ""licorice"" flavor substitute. It is a fragrant component of anisette liqueur. Anise is used widely as a flavoring in all food categories including alcohols, liqueurs, dairy products, gelatins, puddings, meats, and candies. It is sold as a spice, and the seeds are used as a breath freshener. The essential oil is used medicinally as well as in perfume, soaps, and sachets.Antispasmodic/ExpectorantAnise is well known as a carminative and an expectorant. Its ability to decrease bloating and settle the digestive tract still is used today, especially in pediatrics. In high doses, it is used as an antispasmodic and an antiseptic and for the treatment of cough, asthma, and bronchitis. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of anise as an expectorant or as an antimicrobial.Other usesThe oil of anise has been used for the treatment of lice, scabies, and psoriasis.
What is the recommended dosage?
There are no recent clinical studies to guide use of anise. However, typical use in dyspepsia is 0.5 to 3 g of seed or 0.1 to 0.3 mL of the essential oil.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Aniseed is a reputed abortifacient. Excessive use is not recommended in pregnancy.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Anise may cause allergic reactions of the skin, respiratory tract, and GI tract.
Toxicology
Ingestion of the oil may result in pulmonary edema, vomiting, and seizures.

What is Barberry?



The barberry grows wild throughout Europe but has been naturalized to many regions of the eastern US. M. aquifolium is an evergreen shrub native to the northwestern US and Canada. Barberry has spiny, holly-like leaves and is widely grown as an ornamental. Its yellow flowers bloom, then develop into red to blue-black oblong berries.
Scientific Name(s)
Berberis vulgaris,  Berberis aristata, Mahonia aquifolium
Common Name(s)
Barberry also is known as holly barberry, Oregon grape, Oregon barberry, Oregon grapeholly, trailing mahonia, berberis, jaundice berry, woodsour, sowberry, pepperidge bush, and sour-spine
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe plant has a long history of use, dating back to the Middle Ages. Tribes in the Pacific Northwest used M. aquifolium to treat acne, and other Native Americans used Mahonia berries to treat scurvy. The sundried fruits have been eaten for fever-reducer and urine-production effects in Turkey. A preparation of the plant has been used to treat GI ailments and coughs. The alkaloid berberine was included as an astringent in eye drops, but its use has become rare. The fruits have been used to prepare jams, jellies, and juices. The use of the plant in traditional medicine has been limited by the bitter taste of the bark and root. However, multiple medicinal uses for barberry, including cancer, cholera, and high blood pressure have been listed.General usesClinical applications may include use in treating diabetes and cholesterol disorders, although clinical trials are limited. Other activity includes antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. No clinical trials exist to support uses related to effects on the heart/blood vessel and central nervous systems or treating cancer.
What is the recommended dosage?
Daily doses of 2 g of the berries and 1.5 to 3 g daily of dry bark have been used; however, there are limited clinical studies to support barberry's varied uses.
Contraindications
Use with caution in the presence of irregular heart beat. Effective use in children has not been proven.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Documented adverse effects (including uterine-stimulant effects).
Interactions
Barberry should be used cautiously with potentially toxic medicines such as cyclosporine.
Side Effects
GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), dizziness, and fainting have been reported. Effects on the heart/blood vessel system (eg, low blood pressure, decreased heart rate) and decreased breathing may occur with high dosages.  Hypersensitivity has been documented.
Toxicology
Symptoms of poisoning are lack of energy, stupor and daze, vomiting and diarrhea, and kidney inflammation. A median lethal dose for berberine was noted as 27.5 mg/kg in humans.

What is Barley Grass?



Barley is an annual grass. Barley grass is the leaf of the barley plant, as opposed to the grain. It is capable of growing in a wide range of climatic conditions. Barley grass has greater nutritional value if harvested at a young age.
Scientific Name(s)
Hordeum vulgare, Hordeum distichon
Common Name(s)
Barley also is known as barley grass and hordeum.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBarley is considered to be the first cereal grain cultivated by humans. Its medicinal and food use dates back to 7000 BC. Crop reports on barley date back to 2440 BC, and the Chinese were cultivating barley circa 2000 BC. Since biblical times, ancient Asian and Middle Eastern cultures reportedly included young wheat and barley grass plants in their diets. Historically, the plant species was used in the treatment of skin, liver, blood, and GI disorders. Ancient Greeks used the mucilage derived from the cereal to treat GI inflammations. Gladiators ate barley for strength and stamina. The Roman physician Pliny used barley as part of a ritualized cure for boils.NutritionalIn 1940, it was explained how the vitamins, minerals, and protein in the cereal grasses are essential to animals and humans. A dehydrated preparation of cereal grass called ""cerophyl"" was approved as an ""accepted food"" by the Council of Foods of the American Medical Association in 1939. Later, synthetic nutrients were added to a number of foods, and multivitamins gained popularity. The juice of barley grass contains beta carotene, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, pantothenic acid, and folic acid. Minerals present include potassium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, and magnesium. Other constituents are chlorophyll, amino acids, protein, fiber, and enzymes. Cobalamin or vitamin B12 deficiency may be avoided in vegetarian diets by supplementation with dehydrated barley grass juice.Antioxidant activityBarley leaf extract has the ability to scavenge free radicals. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to play an important part in mediating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and can be instrumental in the pathogenesis of diseases such as rheumatoid synovitis, arthritis, and gout. Animal data shows an increased production of oxygen-free radicals with barley leaf extract added to the diet. Clinical studies show blood levels of oxygen-free radicals were reduced by supplementation with 15 g/day barley leaf extract in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Similar results were noted in nondiabetic, hyperlipidemic patients. More clinical studies are needed to show the extent of benefits in humans.Cancer preventionBarley grass extracts protect human tissue cells against carcinogens. The mechanism of action is unknown but may be associated with the plant's antioxidant activity or its chlorophyll content. It has been suggested that complexes may be formed between the carcinogen and the chlorophyll that may inactivate the carcinogen. In addition, antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase, found in high concentrations in green barley juice protect against radiation and free radicals. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of barley grass for cancer-preventive properties.HyperlipidemiaCholesterol-lowering effects have been attributed to the beta-sitosterol components, in part. Beta-sitosterol is thought to act by inhibiting the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and accelerating its catabolism to bile acid. Preliminary animal and clinical data show that total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were lowered. HCL cholesterol levels were increased. More clinical studies are needed to be conclusive.Other usesMany claims have been made regarding the health benefits of barley grass supplements. Suggested benefits include treatment of HIV infection, detoxification of pollutants, and boosting energy and immunity. However, objective evidence supporting many of these claims is lacking.
What is the recommended dosage?
A dose of 15 g/day dried barley leaf extract has been used to lower cholesterol.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Although hypersensitivity to barley products typically is associated with the seed and not the green leaves or shoots, patients with celiac disease or other sensitivities to barley probably should avoid use of barley grass.
Toxicology
No data.

Beta-Glucans
What is Beta-Glucans?



Natural sources of beta-glucans include fungal cell walls, seaweed, oats, and barley. Although collectively termed beta-glucans, variations in composition exist as a consequence of being derived from different natural sources, as well as batch variations due to differing growing conditions. Synthetic substances are being developed to overcome such variations, but until these become widely available, information for beta-glucan depends on the source; see individual monographs for maitake (grifola) seaweed, and oats.
Scientific Name(s)
Beta-1,3-glucan, beta-1,3/1,6-glycan
Common Name(s)
Beta glycans also are known as beta-glucans.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBeta-glucans have been used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, and have been extensively studied for many years, particularly for their potential as immunomodulators. Traditional Chinese and Asian medicines extensively utilize medicinal mushrooms as a source of beta-glucan, while in the United States, early research focused on the immunomodulatory effects of zymosan derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.General usesReviews providing an overview of the beta-glucans are available, focusing largely on preventative roles in cancer and diseases related to the cardiovascular and immune systems. For more detailed information, see the individual monographs for the different beta-glucans sources (maitake [grifola], seaweed, and oats).

Betel Nut
What is Betel Nut?



The areca tree is a feathery palm that grows to approximately 1.5 m in height and is widely cultivated in tropical India, Bangladesh, Japan, Sri Lanka, south China, the East Indies, the Philippines, and parts of Africa. The tropical palm trees bear fruit all year. The nut may be used fresh, dried, or cured by boiling, baking, or roasting. The quid is a mixture of areca nut, tobacco, and lime wrapped in the leaf of the betel vine (Piper betel L. Family: Piperaceae).
Scientific Name(s)
Areca catechu L. Family: Palmaceae (palms)
Common Name(s)
Areca nut, paan, paan-gutkha pinlang, pinang, and supari.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe chewing of betel nut quids dates to antiquity. In the 1st century AD, Sanskrit medical writings claimed that betel nut possessed 13 qualities found in the region of heaven. It is pungent, bitter, spicy, sweet, salty, and astringent. It was said to expel wind, kill worms, remove phlegm, subdue bad odors, beautify the mouth, induce purification, and kindle passion. Because of its CNS stimulating effects, betel nut is used in a manner similar to the western use of tobacco or caffeine. Arecoline is responsible for some of the effects of betel quid chewing, such as alertness, increased stamina, a sense of well-being, euphoria, and salivation. Chewing the nut stimulates the flow of saliva to aid digestion. Betel nut also has been used to stimulate the appetite.Miscellaneous usesBetel nut's medical use is limited, and long-term negative reactions to betel quid chewing are well known. A decrease in positive symptoms among men with schizophrenia was attributed to betel nut consumption.
What is the recommended dosage?
Limited clinical trials exist to guide dosage; limited clinical uses exist.
Contraindications
None well documented.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse reactions, including DNA damage and damage to the fetus. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Betel nut consumption has been linked to the incidence of metabolic syndrome.
Toxicology
Areca nut and the betel leaf have caused DNA damage and cancer in cells and in animal experiments. There is a dose- and duration-dependent association of betel quid chewing with precancerous changes in the mouth as well as mouth, throat, laryngeal, and esophageal cancer.

36,Bloodroot,"
Bloodroot
What is Bloodroot?



Bloodroot is an early spring wildflower that grows in woodlands of the eastern United States and Canada. The stout rhizome oozes with a bright red latex when cut, giving the plant its common name. The root and rhizome are collected in the fall for medicinal use.
Scientific Name(s)
Sanguinaria canadensis L.
Common Name(s)
Bloodroot also is known as bloodwort, red pucoon, redroot, coon root, paucon, sweet slumber, tetterwort, snakebite, Indian paint, and black paste.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBloodroot was used by eastern American Indian tribes as a red dye and in the treatment of ulcers, skin conditions, and as a blood purifier as well as for treating ulcers and skin conditions. All of these medicinal uses derive from the appearance of the blood-red latex exuded from the fresh root. The juice also was used for coughs and sore throats, with the bitter taste masked by placing the juice on a lump of maple sugar that was then sucked. Higher oral doses were observed to expel phlegm and cause vomiting. The root entered 19th century medicine as a caustic topical treatment for skin cancers, polyps, and warts. Bloodroot has been marketed in toothpastes and mouthwashes for the prevention of gum disease and plaque, but studies have found it inferior to drugs such as doxycycline and chlorhexidine, with concerns about its toxicity.
What is the recommended dosage?
Clinical studies are lacking to provide dosage guidelines.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Use of bloodroot as a caustic agent in the form of a salve or paste has led to localized tissue damage and disfiguring scarring in a number of case reports.
Toxicology
Based on epidemiological studies, there is a correlation between the use of sanguinarine-containing toothpastes and oral leukoplakia (a possible early sign of mouth cancer).

Boldo
What is Boldo?



Boldo is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to central Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru. The plant grows up to 6 m in height. The woody, bitter-smelling leaves are used medicinally. Small, green edible fruits are borne from small, pink-white flowers.
Scientific Name(s)
Peumus boldus
Common Name(s)
Boldo also is known as boldu, boldus, boldoa, and boldea.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn Chile, the yellowish-green fruit is eaten, its bark used in tanning, and its wood used for charcoal. Explorers noticed that local South Americans used the leaves medicinally and introduced the herb to North America and Great Britain to prevent or facilitate gas for stomach, bladder, and liver complaints, and as a mild sedative. The plant is used in natural medicine in the treatment of digestive disorders, as a laxative, choleretic (a stimulant of bile secretion), diuretic, and for hepatic diseases. The leaves also have been used for worms, gonorrhea, syphilis, gout, rheumatism, head colds, and earaches. Boldo extract is used as a flavoring for alcoholic beverages.General usesIn vitro and animal studies suggest boldo leaf extract and its part, boldine, possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects, as well as potential applications in diabetes, GI disorders, and cancer. However, clinical trials are lacking to support any therapeutic application.
What is the recommended dosage?
No quality clinical trials exist to support therapeutic dosing of boldo leaf extract. Traditional doses include 1 to 2 teaspoons (2 to 3 g) of dry leaf per cup of water; 0.1 to 0.3 mL of liquid extract (1:1 in 45% alcohol) 3 times a day. Commercial preparations may contain ascaridole, which is toxic.
Contraindications
Contraindicated in liver disease and diseases of the bile duct, including gallstones.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Adverse effects have been noted in animal studies.
Interactions
Boldo ingestion may enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin; caution is warranted.
Side Effects
Boldo-related adverse events described in case reports included severe, whole-body allergic reaction, heart rate disorders, and liver toxicity.
Toxicology
High doses are necessary for toxic effects; animal studies documented various toxicities.

What is Boneset?



Boneset is a member of the Asteraceae, or daisy, family. It is a ubiquitous plant found growing in swamps, marshes, and shores from Canada to Florida and west to Texas and Nebraska. The plant easily is recognized by its long, tapering leaves that join each other around a single stout stem, giving the impression of one long leaf pierced at the center by the stem. Hence its name perfolia, meaning ""through the leaves.""
Scientific Name(s)
Eupatorium perfoliatum
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBoneset has been used as a charm and as a medicinal remedy for centuries by indigenous North Americans. As a charm, the root fibers were applied to hunting whistles with the belief that they would increase the whistle's ability to call deer. As an herbal remedy, American Indians used boneset as an antipyretic (to reduce fevers). The early settlers used the plant to treat rheumatism, dropsy, dengue fever, malaria, pneumonia, and influenza. The name boneset was derived from the plant's use in the treatment of breakbone fever, a term describing the high fever that often accompanies influenza. Boneset was official in the US Pharmacopeia from 1820 to 1900.Miscellaneous usesBoneset chiefly has been used to treat fevers. Boneset sometimes is found in herbal combination products for colds, flu, and fevers. There are no clinical studies evaluating its safety or effectiveness in the treatment of these conditions.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no recent clinical evidence to guide dosage of boneset. Traditional use was at a dose of 2 g of leaves and flowers. Internal use should be tempered by the occurrence of hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids in this plant.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects, including cytotoxic constituents. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
The FDA has classified boneset as an ""Herb of Undefined Safety.""
Toxicology
The ingestion of large amounts of teas or extracts may result in severe diarrhea. The identification of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in related Eupatorium species is cause for concern until detailed phytochemical investigations are carried out on boneset. This class of alkaloids is known to cause hepatic (liver) impairment after long-term ingestion. While direct evidence for a hepatotoxic effect from boneset does not exist, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that any plant containing unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids should not be ingested.

What is Borage?



Borage is an annual plant that is native to the Mediterranean region but has been widely naturalized in other areas. The stem and leaves are covered with coarse, prickly hairs. The bright blue flowers are star-shaped. The fresh plant has a salty flavor and a cucumber-like odor.
Scientific Name(s)
Borago officinalis
Common Name(s)
Borage is also known as burrage, common bugloss, bee-bread, bee fodder, star flower, ox's tongue, and cool tankard.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBorage leaves have been used as a potherb and in European herbal medicine since the Middle Ages. Borage leaves and flowers were added to wine and lemon juice to make the popular English beverages claret cup and cool tankard. The leaves have been used to treat rheumatism, colds, and bronchitis, as well as to increase lactation in women. Infusions of the leaves have been used to induce sweating and urination.General usesBorage has been used alone and in combination with fish oil for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, skin disorders, and bone weakening, although clinical evidence to support these uses is limited.
What is the recommended dosage?
Borage seed oil 1 to 3 g/day has been given in clinical trials (1 g/day has been used in children, and up to 3 g/day has been used in adults). A 2 g dose of dried herb brewed in 1 cup of boiling water taken 3 times daily has been suggested. Oral doses of 2,000 to 4,000 mg/day in adults and 1,000 to 2,000 mg/day in children with skin disorders have been studied.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use.
Interactions
Because borage contains low concentrations of substances that have been associated with liver damage, it should not be used with drugs that could affect the liver, such as anabolic steroids, phenothiazine, or ketoconazole. Borage may also lower the seizure threshold and should not be used with drugs that can also have this effect, such as tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines. Borage oil should also be used cautiously with any medication that may increase the risk of bleeding.
Side Effects
Borage oil should be used cautiously in people with epilepsy. A case report describes the development of seizures ultimately progressing to continuous seizures in a healthy 41-year-old woman who consumed borage oil 1,500 to 3,000 mg/day for 1 week. Additionally, borage has been reported as the likely cause of several cases of a blood disorder in infants in Europe. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking borage, belching and soft stools occurred.
Toxicology
Internal use of whole borage leaf is not recommended.

41,Bovine Colostrum,"
Bovine colostrum
Common Name(s)
Bovine colostrum is also known as cow milk colostrum, bovine colostrum immune milk, lactobin, LC2N, BCC (bovine colostrum concentrate), hyperimmune milk, early milk, and lactoferrin.
What is Bovine colostrum?



Colostrum is the fluid produced by mammary glands during the first 2 to 4 days after birth, before milk is produced. It is a rich natural source of nutrients, antibodies, and growth factors for the newborn. Bovine colostrum is collected from dairy cows shortly after calving.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical UsesThe use of colostrum for both medicinal and spiritual purposes has been noted in the traditional Ayurvedic medical system and among the ancient Hindu rishis (spiritual leaders) of India. At the turn of the 20th century, the use of colostrum was advocated to protect infants against both human and bovine infections. Prior to the advent of sulfa drugs and other antibiotics, colostrum was used to boost defense against immune diseases. Albert Sabin isolated antipolio antibodies in bovine colostrum in the 1950s and the first experiments with hyperimmune colostrum were conducted in the 1960s.General UsesBovine colostrum may have a role in the management of HIV-associated diarrhea. Evidence is promising but weak for use in boosting the immune system, preventing infection, and in enhancing performance among athletes.
What is the recommended dosage?
Commercial bovine colostrum products are difficult to standardize because antibody content may vary widely. Dosages of up to 60 mg/day for as long as 9 weeks have been used in clinical trials.
Contraindications
Contraindications other than milk allergy have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Well tolerated, with minor GI complaints (eg, nausea, gas) occurring infrequently.
Toxicology
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the safety of hyperimmune milks on the basis that no adverse health effects have yet been shown in clinical studies. Past concerns about the transmission of feed-borne infection of cattle have been resolved.

46,Buchu,"
Buchu
What is Buchu?



Buchu is harvested from the dried leaves obtained from three species of Barosma. The species derive their common names from the shape of the aromatic leaf. Native to South Africa, the buchus grow as shrubs with leathery leaves that have oil-glandular dots on the underside. Odor and taste of the plants is described as spicy, resembling black currant, but also reminiscent of a mixture between rosemary and peppermint. Buchu oil sometimes is added as a component of black currant flavorings. Most commonly, B. betulina is used in commerce.
Scientific Name(s)
Agathosma betulina, Barosma betulina (short buchu), B. serratifolia (long buchu), B. crenulata (ovate buchu). These plants should not be confused with ""Indian buchu"" (Myrtus communis), which is native to the Mediterranean regions.
Common Name(s)
Buchu also is known as bookoo, buku, diosma, bucku, and bucco.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe Khoekhoe people (also spelled Khoikhoi) employed the leaves for the treatment of a great number of ailments. Early patent medicines sold in the United States hailed the virtues of the plant and its volatile oil for the management of diseases ranging from diabetes to nervousness. Buchu first was exported to Britain in 1790. In 1821, it was listed in the British Pharmacopoeia as a medicine for ""cystitis, urethritis, nephritis and catarrh of the bladder.""The drug had been included in the US National Formulary and was described as a diuretic and antiseptic. Its use since has been abandoned in favor of more effective diuretics and antibacterials. Buchu remains a popular ingredient in over-the-counter herbal diuretic preparations.Historically, buchu has been used to treat inflammation, and kidney and urinary tract infections; as a diuretic and as a stomach tonic. Other uses include carminative action and treatment of cystitis, urethritis, prostatitis, and gout. It also has been used for leukorrhea and yeast infections.Diuretic/Anti-inflammatoryBuchu remains a popular ingredient in over-the-counter herbal diuretic preparations. Despite the lack of evidence, buchu is still used today in western herbal medicine for urinary tract ailments, cystitis or urethritis prophylaxis, and prostatitis. It also is used in combination with other herbs such as cornsilk, juniper and uva-ursi. Buchu also is listed in the German Commission E Monographs to treat inflammation, kidney and urinary tract infections, and also is used as a diuretic, but the monograph explains that the plant's activity in these claimed uses has not been substantiated.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no recent clinical evidence to guide dosage of buchu. Classical doses were from 1 to 2 g of the leaves daily.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects, including uterine stimulant effects. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Buchu can cause stomach and kidney irritation, and can be an abortive. It also can induce increased menstrual flow. Buchu is not recommended during pregnancy.
Toxicology
Poisoning has not been reported. Buchu contains the hepatotoxin (toxic to the liver) pulegone, also known to be present in pennyroyal.

What is Butcher's Broom?



Butcher's broom is a low-growing common evergreen shrub. It is widely distributed, from Iran to the Mediterranean and the southern United States. The plant develops edible shoots that are similar to asparagus in form. Butcher's broom has tough, erect, striated stems with false thorny leaves. The name of this plant should not be confused with broom (Cytisus scoparius) or Spanish broom (Spartium junceum).
Scientific Name(s)
Ruscus aculeatus
Common Name(s)
Butcher's broom also is known as box holly, knee holly, pettigree, sweet broom, and Jew's myrtle.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesR. aculeatus was given its common name, butcher's broom, because its stiff twigs were bound together and used by butchers in Europe to keep their cutting boards clean. The plant has a long history of use. More than 2000 years ago, it was noted as a laxative, diuretic, and a phlebotherapeutic (beneficial to veins) agent. Extracts, decoctions, and poultices have been used throughout the ages, but the medicinal use of this plant did not become common until the last century. Early investigations during the 1950s indicated that extracts of butcher's broom could induce vasoconstriction and therefore might have use in the treatment of circulatory diseases. The increasing popularity of natural and herbal remedies in Europe in the 1970s reaffirmed its position in modern medicine. Novel uses for this plant have included its use as an anti-inflammatory agent and to prevent atherosclerosis.Venous conditionsA variety of compounds have been isolated from butcher's broom. The 2 primary active saponin compounds are ruscogenin and neoruscogenin. Butcher's broom is the active component in several produce formulations and topical treatments for venous diseases and venous insufficiency, such as varicose veins and hemorrhoids. Limited results showing some promise from clinical trials are available. The German Commission E approves oral use for supportive therapy for discomforts of chronic venous insufficiency and complaints of hemorrhoids. Butcher's broom also may be useful for orthostatic hypotension, although data is limited.Other usesNovel modern uses for this plant have included its use as an anti-inflammatory agent and to prevent atherosclerosis. The discovery of new pharmacological activity of butcher's broom, particularly as a cytotoxic agent, demonstrate the need for continued research on butcher's broom.Butcher's broom has been used in many forms as a laxative, diuretic, treatment for circulatory disease, and cytotoxic agent, although limited results from clinical trials are available.
What is the recommended dosage?
Butcher's broom has been used in clinical trials for chronic venous insufficiency standardized to 7 to 11 mg of ruscogenin. Hesperidin methyl chalcone also has been used as a marker for standardization in the product Cyclo 3 Fort. Extracts have been dosed at 16 mg daily for chronic phlebopathy, while a topical cream formulation was used to apply 64 to 96 mg of extract daily.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No adverse reactions have been reported.
Toxicology
Not known to be toxic.

Calanolide A
What is Calanolide A?



Calanolide A is a compound isolated from the latex of the tree, Calophyllum lanigerum (var. austrocoriaceum), that grows in the rain forest of the Malaysian state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo.
Scientific Name(s)
Calophyllum lanigerum
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesRain forests are a very promising source of natural medicines because of their vast diversity. It has been estimated that more than half of the world's 250,000 plant species exist in tropical rain forests. Searching for natural drugs in these areas, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) contracts scientists to gather specimens for analysis. In 1987, an Illinois team obtained samples from many trees, one of which was Calophyllum lanigerum. Four years later, the NCI discovered that a preparation from this gum tree was very effective against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).HIVInitial studies show promise for treating HIV-1. Calanolide A has been found to inhibit a wide variety of HIV-1 strains, drug-resistant strains, and HIV disease in various stages.Calanolide A appears to act early in the infection process, as calanolide A is an investigational drug. No clinical data is available yet.Calanolide A has been synthesized in the lab and was found to have similar actions to the natural product.
What is the recommended dosage?
Calanolide A is an investigational anti-HIV drug that has been given in early clinical trials at an oral dose of 200 to 800 mg; however, it is not available for use. Its safety and efficacy remain to be defined.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Because this product is a relatively new discovery, no data are available.
Toxicology
Calanolide A is an investigational anti-HIV drug. Its safety and efficacy remain to be defined.

60,Catnip,"
Catnip
What is Catnip?



Catnip is an aromatic perennial herb native to central Europe and now naturalized throughout the northeastern US and Canada. This plant grows to approximately 1 m and has dark green, oval-toothed leaves. The medicinal components of the plant are its dried leaves and white flowering tops.
Scientific Name(s)
Nepeta cataria L. Family: Lamiaceae (mints)
Common Name(s)
Catnip also is known as catnep, catmint, catswort, and field balm.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesCatnip's leaves and shoots have been used as a flavoring in sauces, soups, and stews, and in several patented beverages, as well as in fruit table wines and liquors. The use of catnip leaves and flowers in herbal teas was documented at least as early as 1735 in the General Irish Herbal. Medicinally, the plant has been used to treat intestinal cramps, for indigestion, to cause sweating, to induce menstruation, as a sedative, and to increase appetite. Additionally, the plant has been used to treat diarrhea, colic, the common cold, and cancer. In Appalachia, nervous conditions, stomach ailments, hives, and the common cold have been treated with catnip tea. The dried leaves have been smoked to relieve respiratory ailments, and a poultice has been used externally to reduce swelling. In the early 1900s, the flowering tops and leaves were used to induce delayed menses.

What is Centaury?



Centaury is a small, annual herb, native to Europe and naturalized in the United States. It thrives in boggy meadows as well as in dry dunes. The root is fibrous and woody. The plant has pale green, oval leaves, a capsule fruit, and light pink to red flowers. The whole herb is used in medicine. Synonyms are Erythraea centaurium, C. umbellatum, C. minus. Centaurium consists of approximately 40 species (annuals or biennials).
Scientific Name(s)
Centaurium erythraea
Common Name(s)
Centaury also is known as minor centaury, lesser centaury, centaury herb, centaurri herba, common centaury, feverwort, filwort, bitter herb, red centaury, Christ's ladder, and centaury gentian.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesGenus Erythraea is derived from the Greek erythros, relating to the red color of the flowers. The genus formerly was called Chironia, from Centaur, Chiron. Hippocrates describes centaurium, under the Greek Kentareion and according to legend, Chiron (founder of medicine) used centaury to heal a wound inflicted by a poisoned arrow. Historically, centaury has been used as an herbal medicine to kill worms, to treat dropsy, as a sedative, to treat snakebite and other wounds, and topically for freckles and spots. It is reputed to be an aromatic bitter and tonic for treating GI complaints such as bloating, dyspepsia, and flatulence, and anorexia. Centaury is said to act on the liver and kidneys to ""purify the blood,"" and for jaundice. Centaury also was used traditionally to treat fever, hence the name ""feverwort."" This bitter herb enhances production of gastric secretions, which stimulates appetite and improves digestion. Long-term use of the herb is required for the tonic effects on the stomach to fully develop. Other effects include anti-inflammatory as well as antimutagenic effects. Little research is available to support these traditional uses.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no recent published clinical evidence to guide dosage of centuary. The German Commission E monograph calls for 1 to 2 g of herb daily, while other uses for dyspepsia specify as much as 6.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
There are no known adverse reactions.
Toxicology
There are no known reports of toxicity. Because safety of centaury taken during pregnancy has not been established, its use during this time is best avoided.

What is Chaparral?



The term ""chaparral"" refers to an area where plants adapt to droughts, sun exposure, and fire; however, Larrea tridentata does not usually grow in the chaparral. The chaparrals are a group of closely related wild shrubs found in the desert regions of southwestern United States and northern Mexico, as well as in the dry regions of South America, such as Argentina and Bolivia. Chaparral products found in health food stores usually consists of leaflets and twigs. The branched bush grows up to 2 to 6 m, with small, dark-green leaves that turn bright green after rain and have a resinous texture.
Scientific Name(s)
Larrea divaricata, Larrea tridentata
Common Name(s)
Chaparral also is known as creosote bush, greasewood, gobernadora, hediondilla, jarilla, and jarilla hembra.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesChaparral tea has been suggested for the treatment of bronchitis and the common cold. It also was used to alleviate rheumatic pain, stomach pain, chicken pox, and snake bite pain. American Indians used chaparral for arthritis, bowel cramps, gas, colds, and chronic skin disorders. Chaparral has been used internally to treat stomach problems, menstrual disorders, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, gall bladder and kidney stones, diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and upper respiratory tract infections. Skin application has been promoted for rheumatic and autoimmune conditions, arthritis, back pain, minor wounds, and skin infections, such as impetigo and gingivitis. Chaparral has also been used as a deodorant applied to the feet and armpits. A strong tea from the leaves has been mixed with oil as a burn salve. It is an ingredient in some nonprescription weight loss teas.In 1943, chaparral was approved by the Meat Inspection Division of the US War Food Administration as a food antioxidant. It was used as a fat and butter preservative until better preservatives were introduced; it was then removed from the FDA's GRAS (generally recognized as safe) list.In 1959, the National Cancer Institute received reports that several cancer patients claimed beneficial effects from drinking chaparral tea. Years later, a similar treatment was brought to the attention of physicians at the University of Utah.Reports subsequently appeared in the lay literature describing the virtues of chaparral tea as a cancer treatment.General usesChaparral has been primarily used for the treatment of cancer, acne, rheumatism, and diabetes. It has also been promoted for its antioxidant effects, and as a blood purifier and a weight loss agent. Clinical trials have not supported these uses.
What is the recommended dosage?
Chaparral has been documented to be toxic to the liver at doses of crude herb from 1.5 to 3.5 g/day. Therefore, its use is discouraged.
Contraindications
Chaparral was removed from the FDA's GRAS list in 1968. Increased risk for liver toxicity is expected in patients with poor liver function. Chaparral is not recommended for use in patients with poor kidney function due to a risk of toxicity.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects to uterine activity and liver. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
The creosote bush can induce skin reaction.
Toxicology
Chaparral may cause liver damage, stimulate some malignancies, and cause skin reaction.

What is Coltsfoot?



Coltsfoot is an invasive, perennial plant growing up to 30 cm tall. Golden flowers that look similar to dandelions appear and die before leaves are produced, leading to the name Filius ante patrem (the son before the father). The seeds of the plant are soft, hair-like tufts often used by birds to build nests, and the leaves are broad and hoof-shaped, with hairs on upper and lower surfaces. The leaves and flowering buds are mainly used for medicinal purposes. Although related to Petasites (butterbur), activities of coltsfoot should be regarded separately.

What is Comfrey?



Comfrey is a perennial herb found in moist grasslands in western Asia as well as in North America. It has bell-shaped red-violet or yellowish flowers. It may contain small amounts of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids.
Scientific Name(s)
Symphytum officinale L, S. asperum Lepechin, S. tuberosum L, Symphytum x uplandicum Nyman.
Common Name(s)
Comfrey also is known as Russian comfrey, knitbone, radix consolidate, bruisewort, blackwort, and slippery root.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesComfrey has been cultivated as a green vegetable and has been used as an herbal medicine for more than 2,000 years. Comfrey's original name, knitbone, derives from the external use of poultices of its leaves and roots to heal burns, sprains, swelling, and bruises. In Western Europe, comfrey has been used topically for treating inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, gout, and thrombophlebitis, and internally for treating diarrhea. Comfrey has been claimed to heal gastric ulcers and hemorrhoids, and to suppress bronchial congestion and inflammation. Commercial comfrey sale and distribution is restricted in Germany and Canada because of its substantial toxicity.General usesTherapeutic use of comfrey is limited because of its toxicity. A limited number of clinical trials show short-term efficacy of topically applied, alkaloid-free comfrey preparations in skin abrasions and inflammatory conditions. Although not examined in clinical trials, comfrey may possess antifungal and anticancer activity.
What is the recommended dosage?
Oral use of comfrey is not recommended because of potential liver damage. Additionally, because its alkaloids are absorbed through the skin, use of comfrey as a poultice should not exceed an exposure of 100 mcg/day of the alkaloids. Limited trials have evaluated the effectiveness of alkaloid-free preparations for external use; however, these studies did not examine how much liver damage occurred in patients.
Contraindications
Comfrey is not recommended for internal use because of the liver damage caused by its pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Patients with hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to the plant should also avoid external use. Definitely do not use during pregnancy or nursing, with infants, and if you have liver or kidney disease.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects (the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, have substantial risk of causing fatal liver damage and can cause abortion). Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
The internal or extensive topical use of comfrey cannot be recommended because of numerous reports of liver damage.
Toxicology
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an advisory in July 2001 recommending that comfrey products be removed from the market because of cases of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Comfrey is generally considered unsafe, with numerous toxicological effects in animals and humans.

What is Crampbark?



Viburnum opulus is a large bush that often is grown ornamentally for its attractive white flowers. It is native to northern Asia and Europe. The American variety of V. opulus (also known as V. trilobatum) has edible red berries, while the European variety bears bitter fruit. The trunk and root bark are the commonly used drug products.
Scientific Name(s)
Viburnum opulus, V. opulus var. americanum
Common Name(s)
Cramp bark also is known as guelder rose, snowball, squaw bush, cranberry tree, highbush cranberry, and pimbina.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe American variety was used by the Iroquois for prolapsed uterus after childbirth, and other tribes recognized its use as a diuretic. The Eclectic medical movement in the 19th century adopted cramp bark for dysmenorrhea and to prevent miscarriage. It was believed to be a stronger antispasmodic than the related Viburnum species V. prunifolium (black haw). The bark was made official in the U.S. Pharmacopeia in 1894 and was included in the National Formulary in 1916. Widespread adulteration by mountain maple (Acer spicatum) and other Viburnum species led to confusion about the correct source plant. A later review surveyed the botanical, chemical, and pharmacological differences between black haw and cramp bark.Uterine relaxantCramp bark has been used for painful menstruation and to prevent miscarriage. Animal studies show that cramp bark relaxes uterine tissues. However, no clinical studies examining efficacy in humans have been performed.
What is the recommended dosage?
3 to 4 g/day.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No studies have been performed.
Toxicology
There are no studies of the toxicology of cramp bark.

What is Cumin?



This small annual plant is native to the Mediterranean region, where it is cultivated extensively. The cumin seed widely is used in cooking. The dried seeds resemble those of caraway, but are straighter in form and have a coarser taste and odor. Major cumin seed producers include Egypt, Iran, India, and Morocco. The United States is among the largest producers of cumin oil. This spice should not be confused with sweet cumin, which is a common name for anise (Pimpinella anisum). Black cumin (Bunium persicum) has smaller and sweeter seeds than C. cyminum, but is not commercially important. Another black cumin (Nigella sativa) is not related to cumin.
Scientific Name(s)
Cuminum cyminun, Cuminum odorum
Common Name(s)
Cumin is also known as cummin.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesTraditional uses of cumin include to reduce inflammation, increase urination, prevent gas, and suppress muscle spasms. It has also been used as an aid for indigestion, jaundice, diarrhea, and flatulence. Cumin powder has been used as a poultice and suppository, and has been smoked in a pipe and taken orally.Cumin is a major component of curry and chili powders and has been used to flavor a variety of commercial food products. The oil, which is derived by steam distillation, is used to flavor alcoholic beverages, desserts, and condiments. It is also used as a fragrant component of creams, lotions, and perfumes.General usesCumin seeds are used in cooking and the oil is used to flavor food and scent cosmetics. Components may have antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial, and larvicidal effects. Cumin may lower blood sugar, reduce seizures, strengthen bones, and treat the eye; however, there is no clinical evidence to support these claims. Cumin is generally recognized as safe for human consumption as a spice and flavoring.

What is Damiana?



Damiana is a Mexican shrub also found throughout the southern US and many parts of South America. It has small, yellow-brown aromatic leaves. The red-brown twigs often are found mixed in the crude drug along with the spherical fruits.
Scientific Name(s)
Turnera diffusa, T. aphrodisiaca, T. microphylla
Common Name(s)
Damiana also is known as herba de la pastora, Mexican damiana, old woman's broom, and rosemary (not to be confused with the spice Rosmarinus officinalis)
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe scientific literature on the plant dates back more than 100 years when reports described its aphrodisiac effects. Damiana history began with its early use by the Maya (under the name mizibcoc) in the treatment of giddiness and loss of balance. Its primary use in the last century has been as an aphrodisiac. Father Juan Maria de Salvatierra, a Spanish missionary, first reported that the Mexican Indians made a drink from the damiana leaves, added sugar and drank it for its love-enhancing properties. In the 1870s, it was imported into the US as a tincture and advertised as a powerful aphrodisiac, to improve the sexual ability of the enfeebled and the aged and to provide increased activity to all the pelvic secretions. Suffice to say that in this patent medicine era, it enjoyed some success.Damiana was admitted into the first edition of the National Formulary (NF) in 1888 as an elixir and fluid extract. However, it never made it into the US Pharmacopeia and the elixir finally was dropped from the NF in 1916. The fluid extract and the crude drug (leaves) were listed in the NF until 1947. Although some commercial companies continued to sell it to the American market, damiana had almost disappeared until the 1960s ""hippy"" movement brought it back into popularity.Aphrodesiac/HallucinogenToday, damiana has found its way into a number of herbal OTC products, in particular those claiming to induce a legal herbal ""high.""In the Caribbean, damiana leaves are boiled in water and the vapors inhaled for the relief of headaches. Teas are said to aid in the control of bed wetting. No substantive data is available to support the aphrodisiac effects of damiana. Although it has been postulated that the plant may contain the central nervous system stimulant caffeine, the aphrodisiac effect has not been attributed to any specific components. The volatile oil in damiana might be sufficiently irritating to the urethral mucous membranes to account for its so-called aphrodisiac effects.Despite containing a complex mixture of components, there is no evidence to support claims for a hallucinogenic effect.
What is the recommended dosage?
There are no recent clinical studies of damiana that provide a basis for dosage recommendations, though it has been studied in combination with other agents. Classical dosage of the leaf was 2 g.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects include risk of cyanide toxicity (due to cyanogenetic glycosides components) in high doses. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Significant adverse effects have not been reported.
Toxicology
Research reveals little or no information regarding toxicology with the use of this product.

What is Deer Velvet?



Deer antlers are the only mammalian bone structures to regenerate completely every year. Deer antler velvet is the epidermis covering the inner structure of the growing bone and cartilage, which develops into antlers. This tissue grows each spring on male North American elk and red deer, and should be removed by a veterinarian or certified farmer. The ethics, including use of local anesthetics, and procedures of harvesting antler velvet have been reported. After removal of the deer velvet, it is collected and then frozen or dried prior to its manufacture into various ""medicinal"" forms including powders, extracts, teas, capsules, and tablets. Each part of elk velvet contains varying compounds, but the deer antler velvet contains the largest concentrations of those found to be beneficial. (Antler also has been sold by the slice). Heating during processing may reduce or destroy the purported beneficial effects of velvet antler. Various preparation methods, including freeze-drying and non-heat-producing methods have been reported.
Scientific Name(s)
Antler velvet of species Cervus nippon, Cervus elaphus, Cervi parvum.
Common Name(s)
Deer velvet also is known as velvet antler, Cornu cervi parvum, and lu rong (hairy young horn).
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe word antler is derived from the Latin Anteoculae, meaning ""in front of the eyes."" Antlers are present in almost all members of the deer family Cervidae. The first documented evidence of deer velvet as a medicinal was found on a scroll recovered from a tomb in Hunan China dating back 2000 years. The use of antler dates back to the Han Dynasty 206 BC to 220 AD. A 16th century medical text, Pen Ts'ao Kang Mu, lists several antler preparations including pills, tinctures, and ointments. In traditional Chinese medicine, velvet antler has been used for over 2000 years as a tonic, to improve bone health, to nourish the blood, reduce swelling, and to treat impotence. Later research on deer antler dates back to the 1980s in Russia. Hundreds of articles since have been published including those documented by Chinese, Korean, and Japanese scientists.In Chinese medicine, deer velvet has been used to treat impotence, female disorders, urinary problems, skin ailments, and knee weakness. It also is employed as a tonic in children with learning disabilities or insufficient growth. Koreans use antler velvet to treat anemia and impotence and to stimulate the immune system, treat impotence, improve heart function, muscle tone, lung efficiency, and nerve function.Miscellaneous usesDeer antler contains chondroitin sulfate, a compound that may help treat arthritis. Prostaglandins, also present in velvet antler, are known for their anti-inflammatory effects. Other therapeutically valuable actions include immune stimulation, anti-aging, protective and rejuvenating effects, and beneficial effects in blood and circulation. Research reveals no clinical data at this time regarding the therapeutic benefits of deer antler.
What is the recommended dosage?
A recent study used 2 to 6 capsules containing 215 mg of deer velvet per day.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Chronic wasting disease may be present in antler products.
Toxicology
Toxicity studies of deer antler powder in rats demonstrated no mortality or adverse events on a short-term basis.

Scientific Name(s)
Croton lechleri
Common Name(s)
Dragon's blood also is known as sangre de grado, sangre de drago, and drago.
What is it used for?



Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesSangre de grado, Spanish for ""blood of the dragon,"" has a long history of use for both the bark and the resin. An early reference dating back to the 1600s notes that Spanish explorer P. Bernabe Cobo found the sap was being used by indigenous tribes throughout Peru and Ecuador. C. lechleri resin and bark are used in traditional medicine in South America. They used it internally and externally to stop bleeding, help heal wounds, and treat intestinal problems. Studies regarding this plant date back to the late 1970s. Preparations made from dragon's blood are found in several pharmaceutical products, some of them patentedWound-healer/AntiviralDragon's blood has been used for its antiviral and wound-healing effects. Taspine, a component of dragon's blood, has been documented to have anti-inflammatory and wound-healing actions. Taspine and a proanthocyanidin component also have been shown to have antiviral activities. Animal and laboratory tests have shown some promise for the use of dragon's blood for these medicinal effects. To date, there are no human clinical studies verifying these effects.GI effectsDragon's blood also plays a role in GI health. Practitioners are reporting it beneficial for stomach ulcers, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease when taken internally. Preparations made from dragon's blood are found in several pharmaceutical products, some of them patented. A patent describing use of the proanthocyanidin polymer from croton species (SP-303) as an antidiarrheal was issued to Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. USA. A clinical trial of the principal ingredient (SP-303) in patients with HIV-associated diarrhea demonstrated beneficial effects. This important ""rainforest resource"" has several uses that have been validated by several studies.
What is the recommended dosage?
The standardized dragon's blood product SP-303 (Provir) has been studied for diarrhea at doses of 125 to 500 mg daily.

94,Emu Oil,"
Emu Oil
Scientific Name(s)
Dromaius Novae-Hollandiae
Common Name(s)
Emu oil also is known as emu.
What is it used for?



Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe Aboriginal people of Australia have used emu oil for centuries. The oil was collected by either hanging the emu skin from a tree or wrapping it around an affected area and allowing the heat of the sun to liquefy the emu fat to enhance absorption into the skin.Emu oil was used medicinally to treat muscle and joint problems and a variety of skin conditions. Other purported medicinal uses include the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. The oil also has been used for cooking as well as for keeping leather riding tackle supple.Anti-inflammatory/Wound healingNearly all clinical and scientific studies focus on the anti-inflammatory properties of emu oil. In animal studies, the topical application of emu oil had anti-inflammatory effects comparable to oral ibuprofen. In humans, emu oil was evaluated as a lubricant and aided in reducing scar formation in healed burns. Wounds treated with emu oil also healed significantly better. However, more research is needed to fully explain the benefits of emu oil.
What is the recommended dosage?
Emu oil has been studied as a topical application, but clinical trials are lacking.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No adverse reactions have been reported with the use of emu oil.
Toxicology

False Unicorn
What is False Unicorn?



Chamaelirium luteum is a native lily of the eastern United States. It is considered a threatened species because of a loss of habitat and effects of collection from the wild for herbal use. The roots (called starwort or unicorn root) are used medicinally and are collected in autumn. The plant has been confused with the lilies Helonias bullata and Aletris farinosa (true unicorn root), because of several shared common names.
Scientific Name(s)
Chamaelirium luteum
Common Name(s)
False unicorn is also known as helonias root, devil's bit, blazing star, drooping starwort, rattlesnake, and fairy-wand.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesFalse unicorn root was used by the Eclectic medical movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its chief use was for ""female complaints"" or as a uterine tonic in the treatment of menstrual disorders or morning sickness. Its use in combination preparations for painful or irregular menstruation is reportedly increasing in the United States.General usesFalse unicorn also has been used for appetite stimulation and to promote production of urine, expel intestinal worms, induce vomiting, and as a mild GI tract tonic; however, clinical studies to support any of these uses are limited.
What is the recommended dosage?
False unicorn doses have traditionally been 1 to 2 g of the root as a tea, or 2 to 5 mL of the tincture 3 times a day as a uterine tonic or diuretic; however, there are no clinical studies to support a particular dose. Preparations have not been standardized.
Contraindications
No longer considered safe.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Large doses may cause nausea and vomiting.
Toxicology
Information is lacking.

The fruits or seeds are oblong, oval shaped, about 6 mm long, and greenish or yellowish brown in color with 5 prominent ridges. The seeds have a taste similar to anise. Foeniculum dulce (carosella) is grown for its stalks, while F. vulgare (finocchio) is grown for its bulbous stalk bases. A number of subspecies have been identified.
Scientific Name(s)
Foeniculum vulgare
Common Name(s)
Common fennel, sweet fennel, bitter fennel, carosella, Florence fennel, finocchio, garden fennel, large fennel, wild fennel
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAccording to Greek legend, man received knowledge from Mount Olympus in the form of a fiery coal held in a stalk of fennel. The herb was known to the ancient Chinese, Indian, Egyptian, and Greek civilizations; the Roman scholar Pliny recommended it for improving eyesight. The name foeniculum is from the Latin word for ""fragrant hay."" Fennel was in great demand during the Middle Ages. Wealthy people added the seed to fish and vegetable dishes, while the poor reserved it as an appetite suppressant to be eaten on fasting days. The plant was introduced to North America by Spanish priests and the English brought it to their early settlements in Virginia. All parts of the plant have been used for flavorings, and the stalks have been eaten as a vegetable. The seeds aid digestion. Fennel has been used to flavor candies, liqueurs, medicines, and food, and it is especially favored for pastries, sweet pickles, and fish. The oil can be used to protect stored fruits and vegetables against growth of toxic fungi. Beekeepers have grown it as a honey plant. Health claims have included its use as a purported antidote to poisonous herbs, mushrooms, and snakebites. It also has been used for the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammation, indigestion, to stimulate milk flow in breast-feeding, as an expectorant, and to induce menstruation. Tea made from crushed fennel seeds has been used as an eyewash. Powdered fennel is said to drive fleas away from kennels and stables.General usesFennel has been used as a flavoring agent, a scent, and an insect repellent, as well as an herbal remedy for poisoning and stomach conditions. It has also been used as a stimulant to promote milk flow in breast-feeding and to induce menstruation. However, clinical evidence to support the use of fennel for any indication is lacking.
What is the recommended dosage?
Fennel seed and fennel seed oil have been used as stimulant and carminative agents in doses of 5 to 7 g and 0.1 to 0.6 mL, respectively.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse reactions and menstruation induction effects. Avoid use.
Interactions
One study suggested that a fennel constituent has the ability to inhibit the drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4. Therefore, fennel should be used cautiously with medications metabolized by this enzyme.
Side Effects
Fennel may cause sun poisoning, skin reactions, and cross reactions. The oil may cause hallucinations and seizures. Premature breast development in girls has been reported with the use of fennel. Poison hemlock may be mistaken for fennel.
Toxicology
Fennel oil was found to damage DNA. Estragole, present in the volatile oil, has been shown to cause tumors in animals.

104,Fo Ti,"
Fo-Ti
What is Fo-Ti?



Fo-ti is native to central and southern China and is distributed in Japan and Taiwan. It is a perennial climbing herb, which can grow to 30 feet in height. The plant has red stems, heart-shaped leaves and white or pink flowers. The roots of 3- to 4-year-old plants are dried in autumn. The stems and leaves are used also. Raw, wine- or steam-processed, or cured fo-ti is available in the United States.
Scientific Name(s)
Polygonum multiflorum
Common Name(s)
Fo-ti also is known as he shou wu, flowery knotweed, climbing knotweed, Chinese cornbind, and tuber fleeceflower. This plant should not be confused with the commercial product Fo-ti Tieng, which does not contain fo-ti.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesFo-ti is a popular Chinese tonic herb, dating back to 713 AD. It is used to increase liver and kidney function and to cleanse the blood. The plant is also prescribed for symptoms of premature aging, such as gray hair, and is commonly found in hair care products in China. It is also used to treat insomnia, weak bones, constipation, and hardening and narrowing of the arteries. Regarded as a rejuvenating plant, fo-ti has been thought to prevent aging and to promote longevity. According to folklore, the older and larger roots have the most power, potentially offering mortality.General usesBecause evidence exists of liver injury in humans, P. multiflorum and its extracts should be considered toxic to the liver. However, the plant is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and in the Ayurvedic medical system of India for its rejuvenating and toning properties, to increase liver and kidney function, for treatment of mental disorders and abnormal amounts of lipids in the blood, and to cleanse the blood. Clinical trials are lacking to support claims for therapeutic purposes, but topical applications for the treatment of baldness and in the treatment of nervous tissue diseases are being investigated.
What is the recommended dosage?
Fo-ti is used at daily doses of 9 to 15 g of raw herb, but clinical studies are lacking. A standard dose in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia is 3 to 12 g/day.
Contraindications
Liver disease.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Embryonic toxicity has been reported.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Fo-ti is widely used in Chinese medicine; however, adverse event reporting under clinical trial conditions is lacking. Liver toxicity has been documented.
Toxicology
Because evidence of liver injury in humans exists, consider P. multiflorum and its extracts toxic to the liver. The plant may also be toxic to the kidneys, nerves, and embryos.

108,Fumitory,"
Fumitory
What is Fumitory?



Fumitory is an annual plant of somewhat variable characteristics, often resembling a bush, but also growing as a low, trailing shrub. It has gray, pointed leaves that, at a distance, give the plant a wispy appearance of smoke (hence the common name). The pink-purple flower blooms in spring. The flowering plant (aerial parts) traditionally has been used in herbal medicine. The climbing fumitory, or Allegheny vine, is a North American plant of another genus (Adlumia). Several genera of the family are native to South Africa.
Scientific Name(s)
Fumaria officinalis
Common Name(s)
Fumitory also is known as common fumitory, and earth smoke.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesFumitory has been known since antiquity and was described in herbals from the Middle Ages. Fumitory is a predominantly Mediterranean genus that once was used medicinally. Traditional preparation involved expressing the juice and evaporating it. In traditional medicine, the plant has been used to treat eczema and other dermatologic conditions. It has been used as a laxative and diuretic. Fumaria species are used in Turkish folk medicine as a blood purifier and an anti-allergic agent.Miscellaneous usesFumitory has a long history of use in traditional medicine and has been investigated for its therapeutic potential in the management of cardiovascular and hepatobiliary disorders and psoriasis. Limited evidence suggests that fumitory may have cardiovascular benefits, but there is no clinical data to substantiate this claim. Fumaria extracts also may be useful in the management of disorders of the hepatobiliary tract. F. officinalis is approved in Germany for the colicky pain affecting the gallbladder and biliary system, together with the GI tract. F. officinalis is approved in Germany for the colicky pain affecting the gallbladder and biliary system, in addition to the GI tract. Furmaric acid esters have been used as a treatment for psoriasis for nearly 30 years, and there is renewed interest in this area by dermatologists. Research also reveals no clinical data regarding the use of fumitory for diabetes, although there is 1 animal study indicating its potential use in lowering glucose levels.
What is the recommended dosage?
None well documented.
Contraindications
None well documented.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Because of the lack of pharmacological and toxicity data for this plant, avoid use of fumitory during pregnancy and lactation.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
In 1 clinical study, adverse effects occurred in up to 69% of the patients, with GI complaints (56%) and flushing (31%) being the most common symptoms.
Toxicology
Fumitory is not associated with clinically important toxicity, but large quantities of other members of the family have caused fatal outcomes.

109,Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA),"
Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA)
Common names: Gamma linolenic acid also is known as GLA and gamolenic acid.
Efficacy rating:
ÒÒÒ...Positive clinical trials
Safety rating:
●...No safety concerns despite wide use.
         
What is Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA)?



GLA is found in the seeds and oils of a range of plants including Onagraceae (evening primrose), Saxifragaceae (borage), and Rubaceae (blackcurrant). The richest source of GLA is borage (Borago officinalis).
What is Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) used for?
Overview
Fatty acids are the basic building blocks for all lipids. They consist of chains of carbon and hydrogen with an end acid group. Fatty acids vary in length and degree of saturation and generally are up to 26 carbons long. The polyunsaturated fatty acids contain more than 1 double bond. The double bonds are at carbon 3 (n-3) or 6 (n-6). GLA falls into the latter family, known as omega-6 fatty acids.
The actual location of the double bond significantly affects metabolism of the fatty acid, such that the structure and function of omega-3 derived eicosanoids differ from those derived from the omega-6 fatty acids (eg, arachidonic acid). For example, omega-3 derived eicosanoids tend to decrease blood clotting and inflammatory responses. This contrasts significantly with the arachidonic acid (omega-6) derived eicosanoids, which increase clotting and inflammatory responses.
Unsaturated fatty acids are essential components of cell membranes and can influence receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and signal transduction pathways. They can influence numerous inflammatory and immunological processes.
Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
The evening primrose plant is native to North America and was introduced into Europe in the 17th century. Native Americans consumed the leaves, roots, and seedpods as food and prepared extracts of the oil for use as a painkiller and asthma treatment. Some of these early therapeutic effects are thought to be because of GLA, which is found in high quantities in the oil.
In the 1930s and 1940s, several investigators found dietary supplementation with essential fatty acids such as GLA to be of therapeutic value in atopic dermatitis (AD). The advent of topical glucocorticoids brought an end to this form of treatment. However, by the early 1980s, there was a return to using these agents because of the unwanted side effects of glucocorticoids, and they have regained scientific interest. Over the last 2 decades, numerous other indications have been proposed for GLA.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Clinical studies using GLA (evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, blackcurrant seed oil) suggest a potential relief of pain, morning stiffness, and joint tenderness in rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. Benefits appeared to be increased when dosages were greater than 1.4 g/day of GLA, and administered for at least 6 months.
Cardiovascular protection
The apparent low death rate from coronary heart disease among Eskimos has focused interest on the potential benefits of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A small clinical study showed benefits in lowering total cholesterol and LDL, and raising HDL cholesterol. These effects suggest that GLA may contribute to cardiovascular protection. However, this is still an area of controversy.
Diabetes mellitus
GLA has been studied as for its possible benefits for diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic patients have abnormalities of essential fatty acid metabolism, and therefore require higher amounts of essential fatty acids. Studies have shown that the development of cataracts, retinopathy, and cardiovascular damage can all be slowed by the administration of large daily doses of essential fatty acid. Clinical studies have demonstrated consistent and progressive improvement of neuropathies when treated with GLA.
Atopic diseases/Asthma/Psoriasis
GLA has been shown in clinical studies to reduce itching, redness, and toughness of atopic skin. GLA also reduces the inflammation and overall severity of atopic dermatitis, while atopic disease in children often presents as bronchial asthma later in life. However, there have been no animal or clinical studies regarding the use of GLA for atopic bronchial asthma. Although psoriasis does not have an atopic component, the use of GLA has been investigated clinically with inconsistent results.
Other uses
GLA supplementation has been shown to increase lymphocytes, a key component in immune response. It also has been proposed that GLA may play important roles in cancer treatment. Small clinical studies have shown some improvement in immunologic status with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer and bladder cancer. Clinical studies have shown that GLA is effective in relieving PMS symptoms, including breast pain.
What is the dosage of Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA)?
GLA has been studied clinically for a wide variety of conditions, including asthma, dermatitis, and arthritis. Oral doses in trials have ranged from as little as 0.5 to 3 g per day.
Is Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) safe?
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/nursing
Not to be used by pregnant women and nursing mothers unless recommended by a physician.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No serious adverse effects have been noted.
Toxicities
Research reveals little or no information regarding toxicology with the use of this product.

110,Gamma Oryzanol,"
Gamma Oryzanol
What is Gamma Oryzanol?



Rice bran oil is extracted from the bran fraction of rice, the kernels or seeds of the rice plant. It contains large amounts of gamma oryzanol, a mixture of antioxidant compounds. The outer chaff of the rice seed is milled off to produce brown rice; further milling removes the bran portion (the rest of the husk and the germ portions), creating white rice. The rice plant has long, slender leaves, and small wind-pollinated flowers. The species is native to South Asia and some parts of Africa but is cultivated widely. As a cereal grain, it is a major source of nutrition for a large portion of the world's population.
Scientific Name(s)
Oryza sativa L.
Common Name(s)
Gamma oryzanol is also known as rice bran oil, rice bran wax, rice bran protein, gamma oryzanol, and gammariza.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesRice bran oil is used extensively, especially in Asia, for cooking. It has a nut-like flavor and a high smoke point, making it suitable for deep frying and cooking at high temperatures. Rice bran extracts are used in the cosmetic industry.Isolation, extraction, and purification of gamma oryzanol were first reported in the mid-1950s. It has been sold in Japan as a medicine since 1962, first to treat anxiety and later in menopause. Gamma oryzanol and rice bran oil therapy have been used to manage elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels since the late 1980s.General usesClinical trial data are often of poor methodology, making it difficult to support suggested clinical applications; however, rice bran oil and its components may have applications in high cholesterol, cancer, and dermatology.
What is the recommended dosage?
Rice bran oil has been used in doses of up to 800 mg daily in clinical studies in high cholesterol. Purified gamma oryzanol has been used at a daily dose of 500 mg/day.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified; however, use of products containing phytic acid, a chemical constituent of rice seed, is not advised in patients with poor kidney function.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Rice bran oil and extracts are considered to be very safe, with only a low incidence of minor allergic reactions reported.
Toxicology
Concerns regarding toxicity are largely due to an incident in the late 1960s in Japan when contaminated rice bran oil affected at least 1,800 people. However, rice bran oil has not been shown to cause mutations, or cancer in short-term animal studies. An increase in bladder cancer has been associated with exposure to the sodium salt of phytic acid, but not the potassium or magnesium salts, and an increase of lung cancer has been suggested for high-dose gamma oryzanol.

What is Gentian?



Common in the mountains of central and southern Europe, G. lutea is a perennial herb that produces a cluster of fragrant orange-yellow flowers. G. acaulis (stemless gentian) is native to the European Alps at higher elevations. The roots and rhizomes are nearly cylindrical, sometimes branched, and are longitudinally wrinkled. The darker brown roots have a more persistent, bitter taste than the lighter tan roots. The roots and rhizome of G. lutea are used medicinally, whereas the entire plant of G. acaulis is used. Numerous other species of gentian native to China are used in Chinese traditional medicine. Radix Gentianae Scabrae (Chinese or Japanese gentian) contain chemical constituents similar to those of G. lutea.
Scientific Name(s)
Gentiana lutea L. and other species including Gentiana acaulis L. and Gentiana scabra Bunge.
Common Name(s)
Gentian also is known as stemless gentian, yellow gentian, bitter root, bitterwort, felwort, pale gentian, wild gentian, gall weed, gentiana, Radix Gentianae Lutea.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe gentians have been used for centuries as bitters to stimulate the appetite, improve digestion, and to treat a variety of GI complaints (eg, heartburn, vomiting, stomach ache, diarrhea). Stemless gentian usually is consumed as a tea or alcoholic extract, such as Angostura bitters. The extracts are used in a variety of foods, cosmetics, and some antismoking products. The plant has been used externally to treat wounds, and internally to treat sore throat, arthritic inflammation, and jaundice. Despite the name, the dye gentian violet is not derived from this plant.General usesNo clinical trials support traditional use of gentian to stimulate appetite, improve digestion, or treat GI complaints. Gentian has also been used to induce menstruation and to treat wounds, sore throat, arthritic inflammation, and jaundice.

What is Guarana?



Guarana is the dried paste made from the crushed seeds of P. cupana or P. sorbilis, a woody perennial shrub native to Brazil and other regions of the Amazon. It bears orange-yellow fruits that contain up to 3 seeds each. The seeds are collected and dry-roasted over fire. The kernels are ground to a paste with cassava and molded into cylindrical sticks, which are then sun-dried. Today, the most common forms of guarana include syrups, extracts, and distillates used as flavorings and a source of caffeine by the soft drink industry. Guarana also is used as an ingredient in herbal weight loss preparations usually in combination with ephedra.
Scientific Name(s)
Paullinia cupana, sorbilis, P. sorbilis
Common Name(s)
Guarana also is known as guarana paste or gum, Brazilian cocoa, and Zoom.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesGuarana has played an important role in the Amazonian Indians' society. It often is taken during periods of fasting to improve tolerance of dietary restrictions. In certain regions, the extract is believed to be an aphrodisiac and to protect from malaria and dysentery. In 1840, caffeine was identified as guarana's principal constituent. In the 19th century, guarana became popular as a stimulating drink in France. In 1880 it was introduced as an official drug in the US Pharmacopeia, where it remained listed until 1910. Guarana is used by Brazilian Indians in a stimulating beverage used like tea or coffee. It sometimes is mixed with alcohol to prepare a more intoxicating beverage. The stems, leaves, and roots of guarana are used as a fish-killing drug in Central and South America.StimulantGuarana contains caffeine, a stimulant. By comparison, coffee beans contain about 1-2% caffeine and the dried leaves of guarana contain from 1-4% caffeine.Natural diet aids, which rely on daily doses of guarana, have been advertised in the lay press. Guarana occasionally is combined with glucomannan in natural weight loss tablets. The advertisements indicate that the ingredients in guarana have the same chemical makeup as caffeine and cocaine, but can be used for weight reduction without any of the side effects of these drugs. This is not entirely correct. Guarana does not contain cocaine, and may have serious side effects for some people.The appetite suppressant effect is related to the caffeine content. The energy that guarana tablets are reported to give also is due to caffeine. This stimulating effect is so widely recognized that 1 guarana product was marketed as ""Zoom."" Numerous investigational studies have shown the ability of the sympathetic stimulant ephedrine, when coupled with caffeine, to have a synergistic effect on increasing metabolic rates with subsequent increased energy expenditure (thermogenesis), and to have fat reducing (lipolytic) effects. These effects have resulted in a statistically significant weight loss in animal and human trials when combined with diet.Guarana has been used as a natural energizer, cognitive stimulant, flavoring for beverages, and as a component in natural weight loss products. However, it cannot be recommended as a natural energizer or weight loss aid because of its potential serious side effects.
What is the recommended dosage?
Guarana paste is used as a stimulant at a dose of 1 g, usually dissolved in water or juice. The caffeine content is between 3.6% and 5.8%.
Contraindications
Contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. Use with caution in people with cardiovascular disease.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented low birth weight, birth defects, and premature birth. Avoid use.
Interactions
Because of its caffeine content, guarana potentially may interact with lithium, theophylline, and clozapine.
Side Effects
Excessive nervousness, insomnia, and other health risks in patients sensitive to caffeine.
Toxicology
Research reveals little or no information regarding adverse reactions with the use of this product. Given its high tannin content, excessive use may lead to an increased risk of cancer of the oropharynx.

128,Guggul,"
Guggul
What is Guggul?



The guggul plant is widely distributed throughout India and adjacent dry regions. The tree is a small shrub with thorny branches. The gum, called ""guggul"" or ""gum guggulu,"" is tapped from the stem of the plant, and the fragrant yellow latex solidifies as it oozes out. Excessive production of the gum eventually kills the plant.
Scientific Name(s)
Commiphora mukul
Common Name(s)
Guggul is also known as guggal, gum guggal, gum guggulu, and gugulipid.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe plant has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries in the treatment of a variety of disorders, most notably arthritis, and as a weight-reducing agent in obesity. Other traditional uses have included treatment of liver problems, tumors, ulcers and sores, urinary complaints, intestinal worms, swelling, and seizures, and as a heart tonic. In 1986, guggal was approved for marketing in India as a cholesterol-lowering agent. A commercial product, Guggulow, claiming cholesterol-lowering properties, is widely available on the Internet.General usesGuggul has been used in the traditional Ayurvedic medical system for centuries and has been studied extensively in India. Commercial products are promoted for lowering cholesterol; however, clinical studies do not support this claim. Anti-inflammatory and heart/blood vessel effects are being evaluated, as well as use in cancer, obesity, and diabetes.
What is the recommended dosage?
Clinical trials are lacking to provide dosage guidelines; however, in a US clinical trial of its ability to lower cholesterol, 75 to 150 mg of guggulsterones were given daily. In a study evaluating the anti-inflammatory effect of guggul, 500 mg of gum guggul were taken 3 times per day.
Contraindications
None identified. Caution may be warranted in patients previously experiencing adverse effects to statins.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Although generally accepted as relatively safe, case reports of adverse events exist. Moderate to severe generalized short-term skin reactions to oral guggul have been reported, and caution may be warranted. A case report exists of muscle deterioration possibly caused by guggul consumption.
Toxicology
There is little or no information on toxicity with the use of guggul.

What is Gymnema?



Gymnema sylvestre is a woody, climbing plant, which grows in the tropical forests of central and southern India. Distribution is worldwide and it is recognized in the traditional medicine of many countries including Australia, Japan, and Vietnam. The leaves are most commonly used, but the stem also appears to have some drug action. Gymnema is also known as Asclepias geminata, Gymnema melicida, and Pinus sylvestris.
Scientific Name(s)
Gymnema sylvestre (Retz.) R. Br. ex Schult.
Common Name(s)
Gymnema is also known as meshashringi, gurmar, merasingi, and periploca of the woods.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesGymnema has played an important role in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. Its use has been confined primarily to the management of diabetes and similar conditions of altered blood sugar. As early as 1930, these effects of the plant were investigated. The leaves also have been used for stomach ailments, constipation, water retention, and liver disease. The flowers, leaves, and fruits have been used in the treatment of alterations of blood pressure and heart rhythms. Chewing the leaves destroys the ability to identify the sweet taste, giving it the common Hindi name of gurmar, or ""sugar destroyer."" The plant has become available in a number of commercial over-the-counter herbal products.General usesThe plant has been used in traditional medicine, most notably to control blood sugar. Use of gymnema as a lipid-lowering agent, for weight loss, and to prevent cavities has also been investigated, primarily in rat or mouse studies. However, little to no clinical information is available to support the use of gymnema for any indication.
What is the recommended dosage?
Limited controlled studies exist. Clinical studies investigating diabetes have typically used 200 or 400 mg extract daily, standardized to contain 25% gymnemic acids.
Contraindications
None established.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and effectiveness in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
A case report of liver toxicity exists.
Toxicology
Information is lacking.

131,Hibiscus,"
Hibiscus
Scientific names: Hibiscus sabdariffa
Common names: Hibiscus also is known as karkade, red tea, red sorrel, Jamaica sorrel, rosella, soborodo (Zobo drink), Karkadi, roselle, and sour tea.
Efficacy-safety rating:
ÒÒ...Ethno or other evidence of efficacy.
Safety rating:
●...Little exposure or very minor concerns.
         
What is Hibiscus?



Roselle is native to tropical Africa, but today grows throughout many tropical areas. This annual herb produces elegant red flowers. The flowers
(calyx and bract portions) are collected when slightly immature. The major producing countries are Jamaica and Mexico.
What is Hibiscus used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
The hibiscus has had a lengthy history of use in Africa and neighboring tropical countries. Its fragrant flowers have been used in sachets and perfumes. In areas of northern Nigeria, this plant has been used to treat constipation. Fiber from H. sabdariffa has been used to fashion rope as a jute substitute. The fleshy red calyx is used in the preparation of jams, jellies, and cold and warm teas and drinks. The leaves have been used like spinach. The plant is used widely in Egypt for the treatment of cardiac and nerve diseases and has been described as a diuretic. In Iran, drinking sour tea for the treatment of hypertension is a popular practice. It has been used in the treatment of cancers. Research reveals little or no evidence of these medicinal uses of hibiscus. The mucilaginous leaves are used as a topical emollient in Africa. In Western countries, hibiscus flowers often are found as components of herbal tea mixtures. In Thailand, people consume roselle juice to quench thirst. Karkade seed products (ie, karkade defatted flour, protein concentrate, protein isolate) have been studied for their nutritional and functional value.
Hypertension
A randomized clinical trial evaluated the effect of sour tea available commercially in Iran on essential hypertension in otherwise healthy volunteers. A decrease in blood pressure was seen. However, after cessation of drinking the sour tea, a rise in blood pressure occurred. Although no adverse effects were seen in this study, the use of sour tea for treating hypertension requires further study.
Antibacterial/Vermifuge
Aqueous extracts of hibiscus appear to exert a slight antibacterial effect. In laboratory and animal studies, worms were killed by hibiscus extracts. Research reveals little or no clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as an antibacterial or vermifuge (kill worms).
Chemopreventive effects
Components of hibiscus have shown potential as a chemopreventative agent against tumor promotion in laboratory and animal studies. These components also possess anti-inflammatory properties. Research reveals little or no clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as a chemopreventive agent.
Laxative effects
The plant has been used as a mild laxative. While animal studies show a mild cathartic effect, research reveals little or no human clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as a laxative.
Other uses
Hibiscus has been studied for its use in preventing renal stone formation, as well as its respiratory and sedative effects. To date there is no clinical evidence to prove any of these beneficial medical effects. Additionally, hibiscus anthocyanins have shown antioxidant activity in protecting against hepatotoxicity in rats. Application and action in humans has yet to be investigated.
What is the dosage of Hibiscus?
There is no clinical evidence on which dosage recommendations can be based. Roselle has generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status as a foodstuff. A typical dose as a tea is 1.5 g.
Is Hibiscus safe?
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/nursing
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use. Roselle has emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) effects.
Interactions
Hibiscus beverages may reduce chloroquine plasma levels, decreasing the effectiveness.
Side Effects
No data.
Toxicities
The flowers are considered relatively nontoxic. However, high doses have caused death in mice within 24 hours.

132,Holly,"
Holly
What is Holly?



Ilex species are evergreen trees or shrubs with stiff, leathery leaves. The flowers are often white and produce fruits that range in color from black to bright red or yellow.The genus Ilex consists of more than 400 species and requires a wet and equable climate. They are distributed worldwide except in arctic or arid regions. The major areas of distribution are Central and South America. The North American species are largely ornamental and derived from Central and South American species.
Scientific Name(s)
Ilex aquifolium, Ilex opaca, Ilex vomitoria
Common Name(s)
A number of members of the genus Ilex are referred to as ""holly.""Holly, English holly, Oregon holly, and American holly are the species most often associated with the ornamental Christmas holly. Yaupon, Appalachian tea, cassena, deer berry, Indian holly, and Indian black drink also are commonly discussed with the hollies.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPlants in the holly family have been used as ornamentals and in herbal medicine for centuries. Early history records the European pagans offering holly branches as gifts during the Saturnalia. Early Christians decorated their homes with holly during Christmas, a practice that continues today. The early settlers in the southeastern United States made yaupon tea from I. vomitoria, reserving a stronger decoction for use as an emetic. I. opaca fruit tea had been used as a cardiac stimulant by the American Indians; the Chinese used it to treat coronary disease.One of the most economically important species, Ilex paraguayensis or Maté tea (see separate monograph), has long been cultivated and used in Brazil and Paraguay as a tea-like beverage containing caffeine. The mixed leaves of Ilex cassine, I. vomitoria, and Ilex dahoon also were used for a hot drink called yaupon or black drink. Drinkers used it ceremonially to ""cleanse"" themselves, probably due to its sweat- and vomit-inducing effects. Another beverage made from the leaves of I. cassine and I. vomitoria was used as a stimulant tea in the southern United States during the Civil War.Other usesHolly is primarily used as a holiday decoration. Historically, it has been used in teas as an emetic and a CNS stimulant. There is little clinical research regarding the medicinal uses of holly.
What is the recommended dosage?
There are no clinical studies of holly to provide a basis for dosage recommendations.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
The spines of some leaves may tear or puncture skin or mucus membranes
Toxicology

What is Hops?



Hops is a perennial climbing vine extensively cultivated worldwide. Male and female flowers are located on separate plants. The cone-shaped fruits (known as strobiles) are collected in the fall and carefully dried. Hops is a member of the Cannabaceae (marijuana) family.
Scientific Name(s)
Humulus lupulus
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesHops have been used for centuries to flavor and preserve beer. The bitter, aromatic taste of beer mostly is due to the hops content. Hops extracts also are used for other flavoring purposes in the food industry. Hops pickers have reported sedation during harvest, and hops flowers have been added to pillows for relief of nervous conditions.SedativeHops often is included in combination with valerian in sleep aids. Observation that hops pickers experienced sedation has prompted investigation. There are no clinical studies to validate this use.PhytoestrogenicEstrogenic effects also were observed in evaluation of hops extract for the treatment of menstrual symptoms. There are no clinical studies to validate this use.Other usesHops bitter acids have substantial effects on metabolic enzymes. A comprehensive evaluation of components of hops as a cancer chemoprentative found that it warranted clinical investigation because it had distinct activities at the initiation, promotion, and progression stages of carcinogenesis. There are no clinical studies to validate this use.Hops bitter acids have antibacterial and antifungal activity important for the preservative function of hops in beer.
What is the recommended dosage?
Hops has been used as a mild sedative or sleep aid, with the dried strobile given in doses of 1.5 to 2 g. An extract combination with valerian, Ze 91019 (ReDormin, Ivel) has been studied at a hops dose of 60 mg for insomnia.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
There are no reported side effects when used in moderation.
Toxicology
As an historical food constituent, hops has ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS) status by the FDA. However, use of medicinal quantities of hops may pose more risk than common levels of exposure in food use. A wide safety margin for humans has been extrapolated from animal experiments. Malignant hyperthermic reactions have been observed in dogs that consumed boiled hops residue.

What is Horehound?



Horehound is native to Europe and Asia and has been naturalized to other areas, including the US. It is a perennial, aromatic herb of the mint family. The plant has oval leaves covered with white, woolly hairs, and bears small, white flowers.
Scientific Name(s)
Marrubium vulgare
Common Name(s)
Horehound also is known as hoarhound and white horehound.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe leaves and flower tops of the horehound have long been used in home remedies as a bitter tonic for the common cold. Horehound has been used traditionally as an expectorant and continues to find a place in cough lozenges and cold preparations. It now is used primarily as flavorings in liqueurs, candies and cough drops. In addition, extracts of the plant were used for the treatment of intestinal parasites and as a diaphoretic and diuretic. A different genus, the black horehound (Ballota nigra), is a fetid-odored perennial native to the Mediterranean area that sometimes is used as an adulterant of white horehound.Miscellaneous usesHorehound has been used as a vasodilator, diaphoretic, diuretic, and treatment for intestinal parasites. Initial animal studies indicate that horehound may have hypoglycemic effects and may influence bile secretion. The volatile oil of horehound has been reported to have expectorant and vasodilatory effects. Evidence is limited on these medicinal uses.
What is the recommended dosage?
Horehound is given for digestive complaints as a crude herb at a daily dose of 4.5 g and as a pressed juice of the herb at 30 to 60 mL.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Avoid use. Horehound has emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) and abortive effects.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Large doses may induce cardiac irregularities.
Toxicology
Marrubiin (the volatile oil) has an LD50 of 370 mg/kg when administered orally to rats.

Horseradish
What is Horseradish?



Horseradish is a large-leafed, hardy perennial native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is grown commercially for its thick, fleshy, white roots that have a strong, irritating, and intensely pungent taste.
Scientific Name(s)
Armoracia rusticana, A. lapathiofolia
Common Name(s)
Horseradish is also known as pepperrot, mountain radish, red cole, and great raifort.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesHorseradish has been cultivated and used as a medicine and condiment for approximately 2,000 years. Early settlers brought the horseradish plant to America and the plant was commonplace in gardens by the early 1800s. Hardy varieties were obtained through plant selection and grown easily in the Midwest.The horseradish root is used as a condiment and may be grated and mixed with other flavorings to make sauce or relish. Young, tender leaves have been used as a potherb and as a salad green. Horseradish is 1 of the 5 bitter herbs (horseradish, coriander, horehound, lettuce, nettle) consumed during the Jewish holiday of Passover. The root has a long history of use in traditional medicine. It has been used to treat lung and urinary tract infections, inflammation of the joints and tissues, sinus congestion, and swelling. It was applied to the skin to reduce pain from sciatica and facial pain. Internally, it was used to expel afterbirth, relieve colic, increase urination, and to kill intestinal worms in children.General usesHorseradish has been used internally as a condiment, GI stimulant and diuretic, and to treat intestinal worms, and externally for sciatica and facial pain. However, there are no clinical trials to support any therapeutic use for horseradish. Animal data suggest potential antibacterial and blood pressure-lowering effects.
What is the recommended dosage?
Traditional use for colds and respiratory infections was 20 g/day of fresh root. Externally, preparations with 2% mustard oil have been used.
Contraindications
Horseradish should not be used in patients with ulcers and in those with kidney impairment. Not recommended for children younger than 4 years.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use. Use should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation because toxic irritants are released upon crushing. Horseradish may cause miscarriage.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Irritant effects on lining of the mouth, stomach, and intestines. External use may cause redness and rash. Horseradish is part of the cabbage and mustard family, and may impair thyroid function. Crushed horseradish may irritate mucous membranes upon contact or inhalation.
Toxicology
Ingestion of large amounts may cause bloody vomiting and diarrhea.

What is Horsetail?



This plant is native to Europe, North America, North Africa, and northern Asia. Horsetail is more closely related to ferns than to flowering plants and produces spore sacs. This rush-like perennial has hollow, pointed stems, scale-like leaves, and no flowers. Horsetail grows best in moist and shady areas.
Scientific Name(s)
Equisetum arvense
Common Name(s)
Horsetail also is known as bottle brush, scouring rush, shave grass, Dutch rush, and pewterwort.

What is the recommended dosage?
A water extract of horsetail was used in a clinical study as a hypoglycemic in type 2 diabetes at 0.33 g/kg via the oral route.
Contraindications
No longer considered safe for use.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No data.

What is Huperzine A?



Club mosses are primitive, vascular plants that differ from true mosses by having specialized fluid-conducting tissues, but like mosses, they reproduce by means of spores, which are either clustered into small cones or borne in the axils of the small scale-like leaves. Plants older than 15 years may only grow to 10 cm in height. Some species of Lycopodium are called ground pine or creeping cedar, especially those that resemble miniature hemlocks with flattened fan-shaped branches that are often used for Christmas decorations.
Scientific Name(s)
Isolated from Huperzia serrata
Common Name(s)
Huperzine A is isolated from the club mossHuperzia serrata. It is also known as Chien Tseng Ta, Jin Bu Buan, Qian Ceng Ta, She Zu Cao, Shi Song. Other products containing huperzine A include Memorzine, Brainmax, Neuroflow.
Trade Names
BrainmaxMemorzineNeuroflow
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe use of club moss can be traced back to the Chinese pharmacopoeias of the Tang dynasty as Shi Song, used for the treatment of rheumatism and colds, to relax muscles and tendons, and to improve blood circulation. The club moss H. serrata has been used in Chinese folk medicine under the name Qian Ceng Ta (Chien Tseng Ta) for the treatment of bruises, strains, swelling, and, more recently, organophosphate poisoning, myasthenia gravis, and schizophrenia. The study of the chemistry and pharmacology of the plant and its alkaloids gained momentum in the 1980s from Chinese scientists.Alzheimer diseaseA Cochrane review of the effect of huperzine A in Alzheimer disease, as well as other reviews, note the lack of quality long-term clinical trials to support definitive statements about a place in therapy for huperzine A, despite numerous clinical studies being undertaken.Other usesHistorically, club moss has been used for the treatment of bruises, strains, swelling, rheumatism, and colds, to relax muscles and tendons, and to improve blood circulation. Because of its anticholinesterase activity, huperzine A, a constituent of the whole plant, has been studied for potential use in treating Alzheimer disease and other CNS disorders; however, there is still insufficient evidence to support its routine use.
What is the recommended dosage?
Huperzine A has been studied at oral dosages of 0.2 to 0.4 mg/day for Alzheimer disease.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
In clinical trials, cholinergic adverse reactions have been noted, including hyperactivity, nasal obstruction, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, thirst, and constipation. One trial reported abnormalities in electrocardiogram patterns (cardiac ischemia and arrhythmia).
Toxicology
Symptoms of acute toxicity are similar to those of other cholinergic inhibitors and include muscular tremor, drooling, tears, increased bronchial secretions, and incontinence. No mutagenicity or teratogenicity were found in rodent studies.

What is Hyssop?



Hyssop is a perennial plant which is native to the Mediterranean region and has been imported and naturalized in the US and Canada. It grows along roadsides and is sometimes found as a garden herb. Hyssop is quite similar in appearance to other members of the mint family. Its volatile oil possesses a highly aromatic camphor-like smell.
Scientific Name(s)
Hyssopus officinalis
Common Name(s)
It should be noted that there are a number of other common plants found in North America that go by a variation of the name ""hyssop."" These include giant hyssop (Agastache sp.), hedge hyssop (Gratiola officinalis), and water hyssop (Bacopa sp.). None of these plants are members of the genus Hyssopus.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesHyssop has been noted for centuries in herbal medicine. In addition, there are a number of references in the Bible to plants called ""hyssop,"" although there is considerable controversy regarding the actual identity of these plants. There is little evidence that the plant mentioned in Bible was actually ""H. officinalis.""The ancient use of this plant was an insecticide, insect repellent, and pediculicide (lice eradicator). Extracts of plant have been used as a fragrance in soaps and perfumes, and to flavor liqueurs, sauces, puddings, and candies.Miscellaneous usesThe plant has been used in herbal medicine for the treatment of sore throats, colds, hoarseness, and as an expectorant. Some herbalists also believe that hyssop has beneficial effects for asthma, urinary tract inflammation, and appetite stimulation. Its effectiveness in relieving gas and colic also are listed under its medicinal uses. None of these uses have been studied clinically.Although an extract of the leaves has been suggested for the treatment of wounds, there does not appear to be strong evidence for its effectiveness as an antibacterial.Still used today by herbalists for its beneficial effects, hyssop's volatile oil represents the most important fraction of this plant. It may have some small beneficial effect in the treatment of sore throats and as an expectorant. However, clinical studies are lacking for any medicinal use of hyssop.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no clinical evidence for hyssop upon which dosing recommendations can be based.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Documented adverse effects. Hyssop has emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) and abortive effects.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No data.

Hyssop is classified among plants ""generally recognized as safe (GRAS)"" by the FDA; however, 3 recent studies demonstrate convulsant actions associated with the plant's use in rats.

What is Ipecac?



Also known as Psychotria ipecacuanha, ipecac is a small, perennial tropical plant that is native to the humid forests of Bolivia and Brazil where large plantations have been established to commercialize the collection of ipecac root. Much of the root crop continues to be harvested from the wild, particularly in South America. India also is an important producer of ipecac. At maturity, the roots have a dark brown or red covering, bitter taste, and musty odor.
Scientific Name(s)
Cephalelis ipecacuanha, C. acuminata
Common Name(s)
Ipecac also is known as ipecacuanha, golden root, Rio ipecac or Brazilian ipecac, Matto Grosso ipecac, and Costa Rica ipecac.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBrazilian Indians valued ipecac as a remedy for dysentery, and this information was brought to Europe by Portuguese missionaries. The dried root and rhizome are the source of the medicinally useful products. Ipecac has been widely used in syrup form as a potent and effective emetic. Ipecac powder had been used to induce sweating at the onset of influenza, and small amounts of the extract have been incorporated into cough syrups as expectorants. Emetine, derived from the root, has been used for more than a century to treat dysentery.EmeticIpecac induces vomiting by an irritant action on the intestinal mucosa and produces reflex vomiting and diarrhea. It also exerts a central emetic action. Emetine, one of its principle active components, primarily has a central action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone. The syrup induces vomiting in 15 to 60 minutes and is most effective when accompanied by fluid intake.Debate surrounds the use of ipecac. One study found no apparent benefit when syrup of ipecac was used in the home, although there may be a benefit in certain poisonings. This remains to be proven.Ipecac should be administered to an alert, conscious person who has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison. Do not administer ipecac to someone who has ingested either a corrosive substance or hydrocarbon with a high aspiration potential (eg, gasoline).Maximum benefit can be expected in those patients who take ipecac soon after poison ingestion.AmebicideEmetine, a component of ipecac, also has amebicidal components. While ipecac is not effective against amebic dysentery, it may be useful for amebic abscesses and hepatitis. Emetine injected intramuscularly is distributed systemically.
What is the recommended dosage?
In syrup form, which contains 123 to 157 mg of total alkaloids per 100 mL, ipecac has been used to induce vomiting. The usual dose range for the syrup is 10 to 30 mL, yielding a dose of alkaloids of 12 to 48 mg. Do not confuse the syrup with the fluid extract of ipecac, which is 14 times stronger. Cumulative toxicity requires administration of emetine for amebic dysentery in low doses for a short time with intervals of several weeks before further treatment.
Contraindications
Do not administer ipecac when a patient has a decreased level of consciousness or has ingested either a corrosive substance of hydrocarbon (eg, gasoline) with a high aspiration potential.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects include uterine stimulation. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Repeated exposure to powdered ipecac may cause rhinitis or asthma. Emetine may irritate skin if applied topically. Diarrhea, lethargy, drowsiness, and prolonged vomiting may occur.
Toxicology
Ipecac extracts may be highly toxic and should not be confused with syrup of ipecac. Emetine is a cardiotoxin and has been associated with serious cardiotoxicity.

What is Jojoba?



Simmondsia chinensis is a desert shrub indigenous to Arizona, California, and northern Mexico. It grows in a number of deserts worldwide. It is a woody evergreen shrub with thick, leathery, bluish-green leaves and dark brown nutlike fruit. An equal number of male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. The plant can withstand extreme daily fluctuations of temperature and thrives in well-drained, desert soils and coarse mixtures of gravel and clay. The mature plant produces about 5 to 10 pounds of seeds, which range in size between the coffee bean and peanut. It is an important forage plant for desert bighorn sheep and mule deer.
Scientific Name(s)
Simmondsia chinensis (Link) Schneider (synonym Simmondsia californica Nutall.). Family: Simmondsiaceae
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAmerican Indians and Mexicans have long used jojoba oil as a hair conditioner and restorer, and in medicine, cooking, and rituals. In the United States, jojoba is considered a viable cash crop for the southwestern Indians, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs has funded most of the studies in this area.With the banning of the sale of sperm whale oil in the 1970s, the cosmetic industry turned to jojoba oil for use in shampoos, moisturizers, sunscreens, and conditioners. It has further potential as an industrial lubricant because it does not break down under high temperature or pressure. A disadvantage to its use is its relatively high cost.General usesThe toxicity of the constituent simmondsin in jojoba seed meal and some oil components limits the likelihood of clinical use. Jojoba oil is commonly used in dermatological preparations.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no clinical evidence to guide dosage of jojoba or its oil. However, its primary used in ointments.
Contraindications
Although absolute contraindications have not been identified, jojoba should not be ingested by humans due to potential toxicity.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Adverse effects in rodents and birds have been noted.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Case reports of skin reaction, confirmed by skin patch tests, exist for jojoba oil.
Toxicology
Parts of jojoba are toxic. Studies demonstrate blood toxicity, microscopic cellular abnormalities, and other adverse effects.

What is Kombucha?



Kombucha is not a fungus or a mushroom, but rather a cellulose skin or mat fermented in a black tea and sugar mix. Kombucha tea is a resultant sour-tasting, fermented liquid broth, described as resembling sparkling apple cider. Black or green tea has been used, and a number of other beverages, teas (including fruit-based teas), Jerusalem artichoke, milk, and whey, have also been described.
Scientific Name(s)
Yeast/bacteria fungal symbiont
Common Name(s)
Kombucha is also known as kombucha tea, kombucha mushroom, Manchurian tea, combucha tea, spumonto, tschambucco, teekwass, kwassan, kargasok tea, ""fungus"" Japonicus, Manchurian ""fungus,"" Dr. Sklenar's kombucha mushroom infusion, champagne of life, t'chai from the sea, zoogleal mat, and pellicle.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe name ""kombucha"" is derived from Japanese; it is brewed in a seaweed (kombu) tea (cha). In Western countries, the product typically is grown in black tea; spores are floated on the surface of brewed, sweetened black tea. The vegetative part of the fungus doubles in mass approximately every week. The mass then is divided and the new portion is grown on a new tea mixture. As the growth matures, it ferments the beverage slightly and it is consumed for its possible medicinal properties. Drinking fermented teas has long been popular in Eastern countries, and the use of this particular growth may date back several centuries.Kombucha tea has grown rapidly in popularity in the past year, and has been promoted as a miracle cure for a wide variety of illnesses ranging from memory loss to premenstrual syndrome. Despite claims for its drug activity, some experts believe that the tea meets the US Food and Drug Administration requirements as a fraudulent product: reference to non-US medical studies, an appeal to vanity, ancient origins, and alleged cures for a wide variety of ailments. Some of these claims include curing cancer, rheumatism, and intestinal disorders, as well as reversing the effects of aging.General usesEvidence does not support the drug claims for kombucha teas; rare case reports of severe toxicity exist.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no clinical evidence to support specific dosing for kombucha.
Contraindications
Use in people with weak immune systems, and during pregnancy and lactation is not advised.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Cases of nausea and allergic responses have been reported.

What is Kudzu?



Kudzu is a fast-growing vine native to the subtropical regions of China and Japan. The leaves of the plant contain 3 broad oval leaflets with purple flowers and curling tendril spikes. Because kudzu produces stems that can grow to 20 m (60 ft) in length with extensive roots, it has been used to control soil erosion. Since its introduction to the United States, kudzu has become well established and proliferates in moist southern regions, where it grows vigorously and is now considered an invasive pest.

Common Name(s)
Kudzu, kudzu vine, Japanese arrowroot, kakka, kakkon, Kakkonto (Japan), Ge Gen, XJL (NPI-028) (China)
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesKudzu was introduced to the United States in the late 1800s to control soil erosion, and although widely recognized as a ground cover and fodder crop in the Western world, the plant has a long history of medicinal use in Asian cultures. Beginning in the 6th century BC, Chinese herbalists used the plant for prevention of intoxication, muscular pain, and treatment of measles. Kudzu is native to Japan, China, and Fiji.General usesCurrent interest in kudzu centers on its use as therapy for alcoholism, although sufficient and consistent clinical trials are lacking. Estrogenic activity of kudzu is also being investigated, although clinical trials are limited.
What is the recommended dosage?
Kudzu extract 3 g daily with 25% isoflavone content has been studied in adult heavy drinkers. In another study, 2.4 g kudzu root was given daily.

What is L-arginine?



Eggs, meats, milk, soy proteins, peanuts, and walnuts are all sources of arginine. The physiologically active form, L-arginine, is obtained by breaking down proteins. Arginine also may be synthesized in the laboratory. Because L-arginine may be synthesized in the body, it is classified as a nonessential amino acid in adults. However, in children and in people with certain conditions (eg, infection, trauma), L-arginine synthesis may become compromised and then may be considered semi-essential.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesL-arginine is a nonessential amino acid that may play an important role in the treatment of heart disease due to its block arterial plaque buildup, blood clots, platelet clumping, and to increase blood flow through the coronary artery. L-arginine is commonly sold as a health supplement claiming to improve vascular health and treat erectile dysfunction in men. L-arginine, which is promoted as a human growth stimulant, has also been used in bodybuilding. In the 1800s, it was first isolated from animal horn.
What is the recommended dosage?
L-arginine has been studied at oral doses of 6 to 30 g/day for a variety of conditions. Many formulations have been used.
Contraindications
Absolute contraindications have not been identified. L-arginine is not recommended in patients following an acute heart attack.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Specific information regarding safety and efficacy during pregnancy and breast-feeding is lacking, although several trials have been conducted in pregnant women without notable ill effects.
Interactions
L-arginine has unpredictable effects on insulin and cholesterol-lowering agents. L-arginine may increase the effects of isosorbide mononitrate and other nitric oxide donors, such as glyceryl trinitrate and sodium nitroprusside.
Side Effects
L-arginine has few reported adverse reactions. Nausea and diarrhea have been reported infrequently. Bitter taste may occur with higher doses. Due to its ability to dilate blood vessels, low blood pressure may occur. Intravenous preparations containing L-arginine hydrochloride have a high chloride content that may increase the risk for metabolic acidosis in patients with electrolyte imbalances. Low potassium and high serum urea nitrogen levels may occur in patients with kidney and/or liver impairment.
Toxicology
High concentrations of nitric oxide, which can be produced by L-arginine, are considered toxic to brain tissue.

What is Lavender?



Lavender plants are aromatic evergreen small shrubs native to the Mediterranean region, the Arabian peninsula, Russia, and Africa. The plant has small blue or purple flowers. Fresh flowering tops are collected, and the essential oil is distilled or extracts are obtained by extracting with solvents. Lavender is cultivated extensively for use as a perfume, in potpourri, and as an ornamental.
Scientific Name(s)
Lavandula angustifolia, Lavandula officinalis, Lavandula luisieri, Lavandula stoechas, Lavandula dentate, Lavandula latifolia, Lavandula pubescens
Common Name(s)
Lavender also is known as aspic, common lavender, English lavender, garden lavender, lavandin (usually refers to particular hybrids), pink lavender, spike lavender, true lavender, and white lavender.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesLavender has been used for pain, bacterial and fungal infections, depression, cramps, indigestion, to promote wound healing, and as a sedative. Extracts have been used to treat conditions ranging from acne to migraines.

Chileans drink the tea to induce or increase menstrual flow.General usesLavender has been used for restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, diabetes, GI distress, discomfort following childbirth, cancer, as an insect repellant, and as a food flavoring agent. However, there are limited clinical trials to support any of these uses.

Side Effects
Lavender may cause allergic skin reaction and sun sensitivity. Large oral doses have been associated with nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
Toxicology
A case report describes an accidental ingestion of lavandin resulting in central nervous system depression in an 18-month-old child, which returned to normal within 6 hours of ingestion.

159,Linden,"
Linden
What is Linden?



Linden trees belong to the Tiliaceae family, which consists of nearly 80 species native to Europe and found in northern temperate regions. The 5-petaled, fragrant, yellow to white flowers are collected after spring bloom, dried, and carefully preserved. The flowers are the most valued medicinal components of the linden tree.
Scientific Name(s)
Tilia cordata Mill. and Tilia platyphyllos Scop. Family: Tiliaceae.
Common Name(s)
Linden, European linden, basswood, lime tree, lime flower
What is it used for?
Linden has been used to induce sweating for feverish colds and infections, to reduce nasal congestion, and relieve throat irritation and cough. Linden has sedative effects and has been used to treat nervous palpitations and high blood pressure. It has also been added as an ingredient in lotions to relieve itchy skin. However, there is limited clinical information to support these uses.Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesSince the Middle Ages, the flowers of the linden tree have been used to promote sweating. Traditionally, the flowers have been used to treat flu, cough, migraine, nervous tension, ingestion, various types of spasms, liver and gall bladder disorders, diarrhea, and elevated arterial pressure associated with arteriosclerosis. Infusions of the flowers make a pleasant-tasting tea. Linden flowers were once believed so effective in treating epilepsy that one could be cured simply by sitting beneath the tree. In Greek mythology, ""Philyra,"" a nymph, was transformed into a linden tree after begging the gods not to leave her among mortals.
What is the recommended dosage?
Linden is available in several dosage forms, but there are no recent clinical studies to support a specific dosage. No more than 2 to 4 grams per day of linden in teas or other preparations for internal use should be consumed.
Contraindications
Although no recent clinical data has been published, the German Commission E monograph concluded that the linden flower is cardiotoxic; therefore, linden should not be consumed by patients with a history of heart disease.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use because of the lack of data.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Reports exist of specific toxicity such as contact urticaria, allergy from Tilia fruit oils in rats, seasonal pollinosis, pesticide residues in linden-containing beverages, and contact dermatitis and rhinoconjunctivitis from exposure to linden wood sawdust in the workplace.
Toxicology
Frequent use of linden flower teas has been associated with heart damage occurring in rare cases.

Lobelia
What is Lobelia?



Lobelia is a perennial herb found in the eastern half of the United States and parts of Canada. The base of the violet-pinkish flowers ""inflates"" to form the seed capsule, which is the source of the name ""inflata.""
Scientific Name(s)
Lobelia inflate
Common Name(s)
Lobelia is also known as Indian tobacco, Indian weed, pukeweed, asthma weed, gagroot, vomitwort, bladderpod, and eyebright.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAmerican Indians smoked the leaves as tobacco and used them medicinally for respiratory illnesses. Lobelia was introduced into New England medical practice in the 18th century to produce vomiting. It was also used in treating colic, rheumatism, fever, and asthma. By the 19th century, lobelia was considered an important medicinal plant used in many conditions (eg, abscess, insomnia, tetanus, shock); however, deaths were recorded due to dosing inconsistencies. In 1993, the sale of lobelia over-the-counter (OTC) products for smoking cessation was prohibited by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).General usesLobelia inflata has been used in smoking cessation programs and has been proposed for treatment of other drug dependencies; however, clinical evidence is limited.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no recent clinical evidence to support the use of lobelia.Traditional use of the leaf (eg, to clear the lungs) suggests 100 mg of dry herb up to 3 times a day. However, there are no clinical trials to support this use. Doses of 0.6 to 1 g leaf are considered toxic, while 4 g of leaf is considered to be fatal.
Contraindications
The sale of lobelia OTC products for smoking cessation is prohibited by the FDA due to a lack of effectiveness and safety evidence.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Documented side effects.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Lobelia can cause nausea, vomiting, tremors, and dizziness at high doses. Parts of the plant affect the heart, and heart problems, including low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and convulsion, have been reported. Skin reactions have also been reported.
Toxicology
Toxic dosages of the plant have been described: 1 g of leaf is toxic, while 4 g of leaf is considered to be a fatal dose.

What is Ma Huang?



The 3 species of this shrubby plant that are sources of the drug are native to China, where the aboveground parts are collected in the fall and dried for drug use. The root of E. sinica or E. intermedia is known as ma huang gen and is considered to be a distinct drug, used for its anti-soporific (anti-sleep) properties.
Scientific Name(s)
Ephedra sinica, E. intermedia, E. equisetina
Common Name(s)
Ma Huang also is known as ephedra, yellow horse, yellow astringent.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMa huang is one of the earliest and best known drugs of Chinese traditional medicine, referenced in the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, one of the foundation books of Chinese medicine (about 100 AD). It was and still is used to induce perspiration and to treat the symptoms of bronchial asthma, colds, and influenza.Chemical investigations of ephedra in the early 20th century resulted in the isolation of the alkaloids ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which were identified as the major pharmacologically active compounds in the aboveground portions of the plant.Miscellaneous usesWhile asthma treatment is one of the classical clinical uses for pure ephedrine as a pharmaceutical drug, dietary supplements promote ephedra as the herb for weight loss and increasing athletic performance. Ephedra has been a major component of herbal supplements for weight loss and athletic performance, often with caffeine also added. However, many manufacturers have recently reformulated products to remove ephedra because of legal liability questions. Because of its potential serious side effects, its use is not recommended.
What is the recommended dosage?
Current guidelines suggest limiting dosage of ephedrine to less than 90 mg/day. Medical supervision may be the most appropriate mode for safe administration of ma huang.
Contraindications
Ma huang is contraindicated with MAO inhibitors.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use. Ma huang contains ephedrine and related alkaloids, increases blood pressure, heart rate and causes CNS activity, as well as stimulates uterine muscle. Women who are pregnant should exercise particular caution.
Interactions
Ma huang is contraindicated with MAO inhibitors.
Side Effects
Ephedra use has been linked to cardiovascular adverse effects, including hypertension, stroke, and MI. Patients with hyperthyroidism, benign prostatic hyperplasia, glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, and seizures and women who are pregnant should exercise particular caution.
Toxicology
Life-threatening conditions and deaths have been reported. Many states in the US have banned its use.

What is Maca?



The aerial part of maca has 12 to 20 leaves and the foliage forms a mat-like, creeping system of stems that grows close to the soil. The underground portion of the plant, known as the hypocotyl, is a storage organ and is the part that is used commercially. The hypocotyl can be a variety of colors, such as red, purple, cream, yellow, or black, and is 10 to 14 cm long and 3 to 5 cm wide; a cold climate seems to be critical for its formation or growth. Maca is cultivated in a narrow, high-altitude zone of the Andes Mountains in Peru. Maca has one of the highest frost tolerances of any cultivated plant, allowing it to grow at altitudes of 3,800 to 4,800 m above sea level in the puna and suni ecosystems, where only alpine grasses and bitter potatoes can survive. Maca and several related wild species also are found in the Bolivian Andes. While traditionally cultivated as a vegetable crop, use for its medicinal properties has become more prominent in Peru.
Scientific Name(s)
Lepidium meyenii Walp. Family: Brassicaceae (mustards)
Common Name(s)
Maca also is known as Peruvian ginseng, Maino, Ayuk willku, and Ayak chichira.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMaca was domesticated at least 1,300 to 2,000 years ago and has been used commonly as a food by native Andean people because of its high nutritional value as well as to enhance fertility and sexual performance. Indigenous people used maca to treat numerous conditions including anemia, tuberculosis, sterility, and fatigue. Ethnobotanical studies document the use of maca for depression, and cancer, as well as for menstrual and sexual disorders.The tuberous hypocotyl, or root, of the plant may be eaten raw or cooked, and dried and stored for years without serious deterioration. The root has a tangy taste and an aroma similar to that of butterscotch. Dried root may be mixed with honey or fruits to prepare juices, gelatins, jams, and alcoholic beverages.General usesNumerous studies on the aphrodisiac and fertility-enhancing properties of maca are documented in scientific literature.
What is the recommended dosage?
Maca is available commercially in several dosage forms including powder, liquid, tablets, and capsules. Most commercial Web sites recommend a daily dose of 1 dried maca extract 450 mg capsule 3 times daily taken orally with food.
Contraindications
Patients with thyroid conditions should avoid maca because glucosinolates taken in excess and combined with a low-iodine diet can cause goiter.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
There is no evidence of adverse reactions with maca. Maca has been reported to have a low degree of acute oral toxicity in animals and low cellular toxicity in vitro.
Toxicology
No adverse reactions were reported in an animal study with rats fed maca extract in doses up to 5 g/kg. Its long-time use as a food product suggests low potential for toxicity.

Maitake
What is Maitake?



The maitake mushroom is found in northeastern Japan but also grows and is cultivated in the United States and Europe. It grows in clusters at the foot of oak trees and can reach 50 cm in base diameter. One bunch can weigh up to 45 kg (100 lbs). Maitake has a rippling, flowery appearance resembling dancing butterflies, hence, one of its common names ""dancing mushroom"".
Scientific Name(s)
Grifola frondosa (Dixon ex Fr.) S.F. Gray Family: Polyporaceae
Common Name(s)
Maitake is also known as huishu hua (Chinese), king of mushrooms, dancing mushroom, monkey's bench, and shelf fungus.
What is it used for?
Miscellaneous UsesMaitake has been used for its antiviral action and to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity. Maitake has been studied to a limited extent for treating cancer; however, the information available is not sufficient to recommend it for this use. The mushroom not only stimulates the immune system, but also has been tested in hypertension and HIV therapies.Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn China and Japan, maitake mushrooms have been consumed for 3,000 years, valued for their legendary properties. Maitake's scientific name, Grifola frondosa, is derived from an Italian mushroom name referring to a mythological beast, half lion and half eagle. Years ago in Japan, the maitake had monetary value and was worth its weight in silver. In the late 1980s, Japanese scientists determined that the maitake was more potent than shiitake, suehirotake, and kawaratake mushrooms, all of which are used in traditional Asian medicine for immune function enhancement.
What is the recommended dosage?
Disease-preventative doses of commercial products range from 12 to 25 mg of the extract and 200 to 250 mg or 500 to 2,500 mg of whole powder daily. A trial among HIV-positive patients used doses of 6 g/day whole powder or 20 mg purified extract with 4 g whole maitake powder.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Information is limited.
Toxicology
Information is limited.

Maritime Pine
What is Maritime Pine?



P. pinaster Aiton (previously named Pinus maritima Mill.) and P. radiata are medium-sized pines growing up to 30 m tall with bright red-brown, deeply fissured bark. They have stout needles occurring in clusters, and produce oval cones 10 to 20 cm long. The tree is native to the western and southwestern Mediterranean regions but has rapidly naturalized to other countries, including the US, England, South Africa, and Australia. The largest man-made forest in the world, the 900,000 hectare Les Landes on the Atlantic coast of southwestern France is populated almost entirely by P. pinaster.
Scientific Name(s)
Pinus pinaster Aiton and Pinus radiata
Common Name(s)
Maritime pine extract, Monterey pine extract, pine bark extract, Enzogenol, Pycnogenol
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical UsesIn 1535, a French explorer is said to have used tea made from the bark of the maritime pine to treat scurvy among his sailors when his ship became icebound.

Pine bark extract is available without a prescription in US health food stores and pharmacies, as well as from online sources.General usesPine bark extract has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions and has been studied for a wide range of ailments, including asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, long-term blood flow problems, heart/blood vessel conditions, diabetes, and erectile dysfunction. However, many clinical studies have been small and poorly designed.
What is the recommended dosage?
Doses of pine bark extract have been studied in clinical trials, most commonly at 150 mg per day in 3 divided doses.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Pine bark extract is generally well tolerated, with minor stomach discomfort, dizziness, nausea, and headache sometimes reported.
Toxicology
Pine bark extract is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), based on data from animal studies and clinical trials; however, few studies test safety as a main outcome.

169,Maté,"
Maté
What is Maté?



Maté is a tea brewed from the dried and minced leaves of Ilex paraguariensis  (yerba maté), an evergreen tree in the holly family that grows to 8 to 15 m in height. The green leaves are 8 cm long, alternate, ovate, and have a wedge-shaped base. The stalks are up to 15 mm long. The flowering stage produces white petals that may be clustered into groups of 1 to 15 flowers during the spring season. The fruits are red and contain 4 to 5 seeds. The species is native to Paraguay, Uruguay, northeastern Argentina, and southern Brazil and requires a relatively wet and moderate climate.
Scientific Name(s)
Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil.
Common Name(s)
Maté is also known as chimarrao, hierba maté, kaiha, erva maté, yerba maté, Paraguay tea, St. Bartholomew's tea, and terere.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesYerba maté infusion has been used for centuries in folk medicine as a stimulant against physical and mental weakness, and for treating liver and digestive diseases, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and rheumatism. Yerba maté was used as a beverage for it depurative (to promote cleansing and excretion of waste), stimulant, and diuretic properties by the native people of Brazil and Paraguay. The plant Ilex paraguariensis first was cultivated by Jesuit missionaries in these regions. Consumption of maté is common in Brazil south of the Amazon River and in Paraguay and Argentina. In those areas, the beverage largely replaces coffee and tea. Raw leaves are not consumed, but are harvested from May through September and flash heated to halt enzymatic processes. The leaves are then wood smoked, dried, and aged—processes that alter the chemical composition and flavor of the resultant powdered leaves. Traditionally, yerba maté is served in a small gourd called a maté and consumed through a drinking tube, or bombilla, with a filter attached to the lower end to prevent consumption of the leaf fragments. Burnt sugar, lemon juice, or milk may be used to flavor the infusion.General usesMaté has been traditionally used as a caffeine- and vitamin-containing beverage for its stimulant, diuretic, and cleansing properties. Effects against cancer and hardening of the arteries have also been suggested, as well as weight-reduction properties. Clinical trials are limited.
What is the recommended dosage?
Yerba maté is widely used as a beverage; however, limited clinical studies have formed a basis for dosing. Numerous commercial products are available. A 600 and 900 mg capsule formulation, 1 to 3 capsules by mouth daily, is marketed as energizing, rejuvenating, and adding nutritional value; caffeine content is typically 22%.
Contraindications
Avoid use with an allergy to any of the components of yerba maté. Avoid use during pregnancy and lactation due to documented adverse effects. Yerba maté use in patients with high blood pressure or heart disorders should be restricted.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use due to documented adverse effects. Low birth weight, birth defects, and premature birth have been associated with caffeine ingestion.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Case reports exist of newborns suffering from caffeine withdrawal because of long-term maté use by the mother. Symptoms included increased irritability, crying, and muscle spasms in the limbs.
Toxicology
Some studies suggest that high maté consumption (more than 1 L per day) may be associated with cancer, especially head, neck, and bladder cancers; however, studies are conflicting. Factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, the role of heat-induced injury, and wood smoke in the processing of the leaves, were not addressed.

Meadowsweet
What is Meadowsweet?



Meadowsweet is a herbaceous perennial shrub native to Europe, but also found in North America. Meadowsweet's ornamental wildflowers are creamy, yellow-white, and have an aroma similar to oil of wintergreen. The medicinal product consists of flower petals and some unopened buds, which are used as the drug.
Scientific Name(s)
Filipendula ulmaria
Common Name(s)
Meadowsweet is also known as queen of the meadow, dropwort, bridewort, and lady of the meadow.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn 1597, botanist John Gerard noted that the smell of meadowsweet ""delighteth the senses."" In 1652, English physician Nicholas Culpeper wrote about the plant's therapeutic effects on the stomach. In 1682, meadowsweet was mentioned in a Dutch herbal. Queen Elizabeth I adorned her apartments with meadowsweet. The flowers were used to flavor alcoholic beverages in England and Scandinavian countries. In the Middle Ages, meadowsweet was known as ""meadwort"" because it was used to flavor mead, an alcoholic drink made by fermenting honey and fruit juices. In 1838, salicylic acid, first synthesized in the 1890s to make aspirin, was isolated from the plant. The word ""aspirin"" is derived from ""spirin,"" based on meadowsweet's scientific name, ""Spiraea."" The plant was used in folk medicine for cancer, tumors, rheumatism, and as a diuretic. Today, it is used as a digestive remedy, as supportive therapy for colds, for analgesia, and for other indications.Miscellaneous usesMeadowsweet has been used for colds, respiratory problems, acid indigestion, peptic ulcers, arthritis and rheumatism, skin diseases, and diarrhea.
What is the recommended dosage?
Doses of flower 2.5 to 3.5 g/day and herb 4 to 5 g are considered conventional. However, no clinical trials support the safety or efficacy of these dosages. A tea may be prepared from 4 to 6 g of the dried herb and taken 3 times daily.
Contraindications
Should not be used in patients with salicylate or sulfite sensitivity. Use with caution in patients with asthma.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use during pregnancy and lactation.
Interactions
Because meadowsweet contains salicylates, it may increase the risk of bleeding when given with antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or with any alternative medicines with antiplatelet properties.
Side Effects
Meadowsweet may cause GI bleeding.
Toxicology
Few toxic events have been reported.

Mistletoe
What is Mistletoe?



Mistletoe is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a wide variety of host trees such as pine, oak, birch, and apple. The term hemiparasitic is used to indicate that the mistletoe plant carries out photosynthesis independently but obtains water and minerals from the host.
Scientific Name(s)
Viscum album L. (European mistletoe) and Phoradendron tomentosum (DC.) Engelm. ex A. Gray (Christmas mistletoe).
Common Name(s)
Mistletoe, bird lime, all heal, devil's fuge, golden bough, mistel (German), Iscador
Trade Names
Iscador
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMistletoe preparations have been used medicinally in Europe for centuries to treat epilepsy, infertility, hypertension, and arthritis. The Celtic priests, known as Druids, revered the oak tree and the mistletoe that grew on it, according to Roman author and naturalist Gaius Plinius Secundus (also known as Pliny the Elder). At the winter celebration of Samhain, the sacred oaks were bare except for the green boughs of mistletoe, and this was taken as a sign of eternal fertility. The Celts placed a sprig of mistletoe above the door of their houses and its sacred nature prohibited fighting beneath it. This evolved over centuries into the custom of kissing underneath mistletoe at Christmas. In 1921, the Austrian anthroposophical spiritual leader Rudolf Steiner suggested that mistletoe might be used to treat cancer, based on the observation that mistletoe, like cancer, is parasitic and lethal to its host. Swiss and German clinics were founded to implement this idea and still actively use a mistletoe preparation fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 3 days. Mistletoe extracts contain several toxic proteins, several of which are lectins, or proteins capable of binding to specific sugars.General usesMistletoe has been used to treat cancer, although there is a lack of quality clinical trials and no evidence of an effect. Most evidence is ancedotal and based on case reports. Further study is needed. In folk medicine, it has been used for its cardiovascular properties, but its clinical efficacy has not been established. Injectable mistletoe extract is widely used in Europe but is not licensed for use in the United States.

The common mullein, usually found throughout the US, is a woolly-leafed biennial plant. During its first year of growth, the large leaves form a low-lying basal rosette. In the spring of the second year, the plant develops a tall stem that can grow to more than 1.22 m in height. The top portion of the stem develops yellow flowers that have a faint, honey-like odor. This, along with the stamens, constitutes the active ingredient.
Scientific Name(s)
Verbascum thapsus, V. phlomoides, V. thapsiforme
Common Name(s)
Mullein also is known as American mullein, European or orange mullein, candleflower, candlewick, higtaper and lungwort.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMullein boasts an illustrious history as a favored herbal remedy and, consequently, has found use in various disorders. Its traditional uses generally have focused on the management of respiratory disorders where it was used to treat asthma, coughs, tuberculosis, and related respiratory problems. However, in its various forms, the plant has been used to treat hemorrhoids, burns, bruises, and gout. Preparations of the plant have been ingested, applied topically, and smoked. The yellow flowers once were used as a source of yellow hair dye. In Appalachia, the plant has been used to treat colds and the boiled root administered for croup. Leaves were applied topically to soften and protect the skin. An oil derived from the flowers has been used to soothe earaches.Miscellaneous usesThere is little evidence to indicate that the plant can offer more than mild astringent and topical soothing effects. It may have mild demulcent properties when ingested. Mullein has expectorant and cough suppressant properties that make it useful for symptomatic treatment of sore throat and cough. Antiviral activity of mullein has been reported against herpes and influenza. Clinical research is lacking.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no recent clinical evidence to support specific dosage of mullein. However, classical use of the herb was 3 to 4 g daily.

Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
No adverse effects have been reported.

What is Papaya?



Papaya is a small, bushy tree with a hollow trunk, large palmate leaves, and oblong smooth-skinned fruits (melons). The melons are usually picked in a green state and allowed to ripen. When ripe, the flesh is sweet and juicy and similar in taste to other melons.
Scientific Name(s)
Carica papaya
Common Name(s)
Papaya is also known as pawpaw and melon tree.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPapaya, a tropical plant believed to have originated in southern Mexico and Central America, is now cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. C. papaya is cultivated for its edible ripe fruit; its juice is a popular beverage, and its young leaves, shoots, and fruits are cooked as a vegetable. The fruits are a source of flavoring used in candies, jellies, preserves, and ice cream. Shallow cuts on the surface of fully grown but unripe fruits cause a milky sap or latex to ooze that is collected, dried, and termed ""crude papain."" Papain has many industrial uses, as well as milk-clotting (rennet) and protein-digesting properties. Nearly 80% of American beer is treated with papain, which allows the beer to remain clear upon cooling. Papain is most commonly used commercially in meat tenderizers and chewing gums. Cosmetically, papain is used in some toothpastes, shampoos, and facial creams.Miscellaneous usesPapaya has been used widely in folk medicine for many ailments: the juice for warts, corns, cancers, tumors, and thickened skin; the roots or their extracts for cancers of the uterus, syphilis, the tropical infection, hemorrhoids, and to remove mineral concretions in the urine; the unripe fruit as a mild laxative or diuretic, and to stimulate lactation, labor, or abortion; the ripe fruit for rheumatism and alkalinizing the urine; the seeds for intestinal worms or to stimulate menstruation or abortion; the leaves as a poultice for nervous pains and elephantoid growths, or smoked for asthma relief; and the latex for psoriasis, ringworm, indigestion, or applied externally as an antiseptic or to heal burns or scalds, or applied to the cervix to contract the uterus.General usesIn some developing countries, the traditional use of papaya is being investigated as an alternative to standard treatments for a range of ailments. C. papaya has a wide range of purported medicinal properties for treatment of diabetes, as birth control, as an antiseptic, antimicrobial, or diuretic, to control parasites, reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, and lower cholesterol. While there are only limited data to support most of these uses, there is some evidence for healing bed sores and other wounds and in treating intestinal worms in humans.
What is the recommended dosage?
A commercially produced ointment to debride wounds is available by prescription in the United States. Each 1 g contains 8.3 × 105 USP units papain and 100 mg of urea. There is very little data available to make specific recommendations regarding systemic doses of papaya. One study used a 4 g dose of air-dried papaya seeds in 20 mL of honey to treat helminthiasis. In the United States, the fruit is generally recognized as safe (GRAS status) when used as a food.
Contraindications
Papaya may cause severe allergic reactions and is therefore contraindicated in sensitive people.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Possibly unsafe depending on the part of the plant being used and dose administered. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Papaya may cause severe allergic reactions in sensitive people. Papaya latex can be a severe irritant and vesicant on skin. Papaya juice and papaya seeds are unlikely to cause adverse effects when taken orally; however, papaya leaves at high doses may cause stomach irritation.
Toxicology
There are parts of the plant (eg, seeds) that contain benzyl isothiocyanate, which may cause poisoning at high doses.

What is Parsley?



Parsley is an annual herb indigenous to the Mediterranean region, but now cultivated worldwide. It has erect stems and bright green leaves. Two cultivars of parsley exist: a curly leaf type and a flat leaf type. Parsley produces an umbel of tiny flowers and characteristic ribbed seeds.Caution must be used when gathering wild parsley because of the general similarity of its leaves and flowers to 3 common poisonous plants. The first, Aethusa cynapium (dog poison, fool's parsley, small hemlock) may be distinguished from parsley by the shiny, yellow-green underside of the leaves, which are dull in parsley, and the white flowers, which are yellowish in parsley. Similarly, collectors should be aware of Conium maculatum (poison hemlock, water hemlock, poison parsley) and Cicuta maculata (water hemlock). Poison hemlock is a much larger plant than common parsley. Poisonings have occurred when the leaves of Conium were mistaken for parsley and the seeds for anise. Symptoms of Conium and Cicuta poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, paralysis, weak pulse, dilated pupils, convulsions, and death.
Scientific Name(s)
Petroselinum crispum
Common Name(s)
Parsley also is known as rock parsley and garden parsley.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesParsley leaves and roots are popular as condiments and garnish worldwide. In Lebanon, parsley is a major ingredient in the national dish tabbouleh. An average adult may consume as much as 50 g of parsley per meal.Miscellaneous usesParsley has been used as a source of certain vitamins and minerals. Parsley seed was used traditionally as a carminative to decrease flatulence and colic pain. The root was used as a diuretic and the juice to treat kidney ailments. Parsley oil also has been used to regulate menstrual flow in the treatment of amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea, and is purported to be an abortive. Bruised leaves have been used to treat tumors, insect bites, lice, skin parasites, and contusions. At one time, parsley tea was used to treat dysentery and gallstones. Other reported traditional uses include treatment of diseases of the prostate, liver, and spleen. Historically, parsley also has been used in the treatment of anemia, arthritis, and cancers, as an expectorant, antimicrobial, aphrodisiac, hypotensive, diuretic, and laxative. It also has been used as a scalp lotion to stimulate hair growth. However, there have been no clinical trials to confirm these uses.
What is the recommended dosage?
Parsley has been used at daily doses of 6 g. However, no clinical studies have been found that support this dose. The essential oil should not be used because of toxicity.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Generally recognized as safe when used as food. Safety and efficacy for dosages above those in foods are unproven and should be avoided. Emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) and abortive effects in higher doses.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Adverse effects from the ingestion of parsley oil include headache, giddiness, loss of balance, convulsions, and renal damage. The psoralen compounds found in parsley have been linked to a photodermatitis reaction found among parsley cutters.
Toxicology
While no major toxicities have been reported with the use of parsley, pregnant women should not take parsley because of possible uterotonic effects.

What is Pennyroyal?



Both plants are members of the mint family and both are referred to as pennyroyal. H. pulegioides (American pennyroyal) grows in woods through most of the northern and eastern US and Canada while M. pulegium is found in parts of Europe. Pennyroyal is a perennial, creeping herb with small, lilac flowers at the stem ends. The leaves are grayish green and, like other mint family members, very aromatic.
Scientific Name(s)
Hedeoma pulegioides, Mentha pulegium
Common Name(s)
Pennyroyal also is known as American pennyroyal, squawmint, mosquito plant, and pudding grass.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPennyroyal has been recorded in history as far back as the first century AD, when it was mentioned by Roman naturalist Pliny and Greek physician Dioscorides. In the 17th century, English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper wrote about some uses for the plant including its role in women's ailments, venomous bites, and digestion. European settlers used the plant for respiratory ailments, mouth sores, and female disorders. The plant's oil has been used as a flea-killing bath, hence the name pulegioides (from the Latin word meaning flea), and has been used externally as a rubefacient (counter-irritant). In addition, the oil has found frequent use among natural health advocates as an abortive and as a means of inducing delayed menses. The oil and infusions of the leaves have been used in the treatment of weakness and stomach pains.Miscellaneous usesPennyroyal has been used as an insect repellent, antiseptic, fragrance, flavoring, as an emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow), carminative, stimulant, antispasmodic and for bowel disorders, skin eruptions, and pneumonia. The abortive effect of the oil is thought to be caused by irritation of the uterus with subsequent uterine contraction. Its action is unpredictable and dangerous. The dose at which the herb induces abortion is close to lethal, and in some cases it is lethal. Pennyroyal is not considered safe for ingestion for any use.
What is the recommended dosage?
Pennyroyal usually is used as the volatile oil as an abortive. Because of severe toxicity at doses of 5 g, it should not be used.
Contraindications
No longer considered safe.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use. Abortive, hepatotoxic (toxic to liver), and neurotoxic.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Pennyroyal may cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, increased blood pressure and increased pulse rate, and dermatitis. In tea form, small amounts have been used without reported side effects.
Toxicology
In large portions, pennyroyal can cause abortion, irreversible renal damage, severe liver damage and death. A small amount of oil can produce delirium, unconsciousness, shock, seizures and auditory and visual hallucinations.

What is Periwinkle?



Although the plant is said to be native to the West Indies, it first was described in Madagascar. The periwinkle is a perennial herb with flowers that can bloom throughout the year, depending on the climate. These often are bred for their unique colors, ranging from white to green-yellow and lavender. Also referred to as Lochnera rosea, Vinca rosea, and Ammocallis rosea. The related plant Vinca minor (common periwinkle, Myrtle) is used as a ground cover.
Scientific Name(s)
Catharanthus roseus
Common Name(s)
Periwinkle also is known as red periwinkle, Madagascar or Cape periwinkle, old maid, church-flower, ram-goat rose, ""myrtle,"" and magdalena.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe plant was introduced in Europe during the mid-1700s, during which time it was cultivated as an ornamental. Today it grows throughout much of the world and plantations have been established on most continents in the warmer climates. The plant has been widely used in tropical folk medicine. Decoctions of the plant have been used for maladies ranging from ocular inflammation, diabetes, and hemorrhage to treating insect stings and cancers.Miscellaneous usesPeriwinkle alkaloids have been used in the treatment of leukemia, Hodgkin disease, malignant lymphomas, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, Kaposi sarcoma, mycosis fungoides, to improve cerebral blood flow, and treat high blood pressure.The most well known of the ""vinca"" alkaloids derived from C. roseus are vinblastine (vincaleukoblastine, Velban) and vincristine (leurocristine, Oncovin), which are now widely used pharmaceutical anticancer agents. An extensive body of literature exists on the clinical uses of the various purified alkaloids of Catharanthus.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no recent clinical evidence to support specific doses of periwinkle herb. The pure alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine are used in cancer therapy at single weekly IV doses of 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg and 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg respectively.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Do not self-administer the plant periwinkle. Physicians will inform patients using pharmaceutical forms of periwinkle of possible adverse reactions.

What is Peru Balsam?



Peru balsam is a tall tree native to Central and South America. The plant bears evergreen leaves and white flowers. The hardwood tree contains oil that is naturally resistant to insects and has a characteristic scent.
Scientific Name(s)
Myroxylon balsamum
Common Name(s)
Peru balsam is also known as balsam of Peru, balsamo blanco, baumier du Perou, Peruvian balsam, Indian balsam, black balsam, and Perubalsambaum.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesCrude Peru balsam is a dark brown, thick liquid with an aromatic smell similar to that of cinnamon and vanilla and a bitter taste. It is obtained from the tree after the bark has been removed; the trunk is wrapped with rags that are later boiled to extract the resin.The balsam was imported almost exclusively from El Salvador to Europe through Peruvian ports, which is how the material derived its name. Central and South American natives used the material to stop bleeding and promote wound healing, and also to increase urination and to expel worms. It was once used widely as a treatment for scabies; it has also been used in suppositories for hemorrhoids and in dentistry in the treatment of ""dry socket"" after teeth are pulled, and in dental impression material. Today, the material is in a number of pharmaceutical preparations and plays an important role in perfumes. The material should not be swallowed.General usesPeru balsam has been used in the treatment of dry socket in dentistry, on the skin as a treatment for wounds and ulcers, and in suppositories for hemorrhoids. However, there are only older, small studies to support these uses.
What is the recommended dosage?
Peru balsam has been used on the skin in 5% to 20% formulations for wounds and burns. Case reports and small clinical studies report the effectiveness of balsam combined with other ingredients in the management of certain wounds; however, there are no recent clinical studies to support appropriate dosing.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. A toxic reaction following application of Peru balsam to the nipples of breast-feeding mothers has been reported.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Peru balsam is an allergen.

Pineapple
What is Pineapple?



The well-known pineapple fruit is actually a complex flower head that forms around the stem. Each of the eyes on the surface is the dried base of a small flower. The pineapple is the only cultivated fruit whose main stem runs completely through it. The top crown of leaves contains a bud that, when mature, indicates that the fruit is ready for cutting. The crowns from the top of the fruit are usually used for propagation because pineapples contain no viable seeds; occasionally, slips from the base of the fruit or suckers are used if planting material is in short supply. The plant grows to a height of 1 m; the first crop is ready for harvesting approximately 18 months after planting. Because the plant uses water very efficiently, pineapple may be grown in areas of relatively low rainfall (50 to 200 cm).

What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe pineapple is native to South America and was brought to Europe by Spanish explorers. Planting began on a large scale in Hawaii early in the 19th century. Growth of the industry peaked in the 1950s, then declined slowly under the pressure of international competition. Today, the bulk of the world's pineapple crop comes from Thailand, the Philippines, and Brazil. Traditional uses include the brewing of pineapple wine, production of fiber, and medicinal use to induce menstruation, induce abortion, kill parasitic amoebas, and expel worms.General usesFew well-controlled clinical trials have been published to support the wide range of therapeutic claims for bromelain, a crude, aqueous extract of pineapple. Evidence exists primarily for the use of bromelain in debridement of burns and as an anti-inflammatory agent.
What is the recommended dosage?
Two slices of pineapple contain approximately 100 mg of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The usual dosage of bromelain is 40 mg taken 3 or 4 times daily. Pineapple products are available commercially in liquid, tablet, and capsule doseforms. Most products contain bromelain 500 mg; manufacturers suggest a dose of 500 to 1,000 mg daily.
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to any of the components in pineapple. Cross-reaction with honeybee venom, olive tree pollen, celery, cypress pollen, bromelain, and papain have been reported.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Data is lacking to support the historical use of pineapple to induce menstruation and abortion.
Interactions
Potentiation of amoxicillin and tetracycline because of increased volume of distribution by bromelain has been documented.
Side Effects
The juice from unripe pineapples can cause severe vomiting. Bromelain ingestion is associated with a low incidence of adverse reactions, including diarrhea, excess menstrual flow, nausea, skin rash, and vomiting. Swelling of the mouth and cheeks can result from eating large amounts of the fruit.
Toxicology
Bromelain has very low toxicity.

196,Plantain,"
Plantain
What is Plantain?



Plantain is a perennial weed with almost worldwide distribution. There are about 250 species. P. lanceolata and P. major are among the most widely distributed, and they grow aggressively. Plantain is wind-pollinated, facilitating its growth where there are no bees and few other plantain plants. P. major produces 13,000 to 15,000 seeds per plant, and the seeds have been reported to remain viable in soil for up to 60 years. P. lanceolata produces 2,500 to 10,000 seeds per plant and has a somewhat shorter seed viability. Plantain seeds can survive passage through the gut of birds and other animals, facilitating their distribution. Plantain, or psyllium seeds, are small (1.5 to 3.5 mm), oval, boat-shaped, dark reddish-brown, odorless, and nearly tasteless. They are coated with mucilage, which aids in their transportation by allowing adhesion to various surfaces.
Scientific Name(s)
Plantago lanceolata, P. major, P. psyllium, P. arenaria (P. ramosa) (Spanish or French psyllium seed), P. ovata (Blond or Indian plantago seed). (Not to be confused with Musa paradisiacae, or edible plantain.)
Common Name(s)
Plantain also is known as Spanish psyllium, French psyllium, blond plantago, Indian plantago, psyllium seed, flea seed, and black psyllium.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPlantain has long been associated with agriculture. Certain species have been spread by human colonization, particularly that of Europeans. As such, North American Indians and New Zealand Maori refer to plantain as ""Englishman's foot,"" because it spread from areas of English settlement. P. lanceolata and P. major have been used in herbal remedies and sometimes were carried to colonies intentionally for that purpose. Psyllium seed has been found in malt refuse (formerly used as fertilizer) and wool imported to England. It has been commonly used in birdseed. Pulverized seeds are mixed with oil and applied topically to inflamed sites. Decoctions have been mixed with honey for sore throats. The seeds and refined colloid are used commonly in commercial bulk laxative preparations.Miscellaneous usesThe psyllium in plantain has been used as GI therapy, to treat hyperlipidemia, for anticancer effects, and for respiratory treatment. In human studies, plantain has been effective for chronic bronchitis, asthma, cough, and cold. Clinical studies show that psyllium seed is useful as a bulk laxative. Many reports on psyllium have concluded that it can be helpful in treating various hyperlipidemias. A polyphenolic compound from P. major leaves was found to exhibit cholesterol-lowering activity. In addition, the mechanism by which plantago reduces cholesterol also may include enhancement of cholesterol elimination as fecal bile acids. Research reveals no information regarding the use of plantain as an anticancer agent.
What is the recommended dosage?
Plantain leaves have been given as a tea for cold and cough at 3 to 6/day.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Avoid use. Uterine activity, laxative.
Interactions
Patients taking lithium or carbamazepine should avoid coadministration of plantain. Caution patients receiving lithium or carbamazepine to consult their health care provider before using herbal products.
Side Effects
Adverse events include anaphylaxis, chest congestion, sneezing and watery eyes, occupational asthma, and a situation involving the occurrence of a giant phytobezoar (a gastric concretion composed of vegetable matter) composed of psyllium seed husks.
Toxicology
The pollen contains allergenic glycoproteins, as well as components that bind IgE. IgE antibodies have been demonstrated. The IgE-mediated sensitization has contributed to seasonal allergy.

200,Propolis,"
Propolis
Common Name(s)
Propolis also is known as Propolis balsam, propolis resin, propolis wax, bee glue, hive dross.
What is Propolis?



Propolis is a natural resin collected from the buds of conifers and other trees by honeybees. It is used by bees to seal walls and strengthen combs of hives, as well as to embalm dead invaders. It is a sticky, greenish-brown mass with a slight aromatic odor.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPropolis has been used as a medicinal agent since ancient times. It was used in folk medicine as early as 300 BC for cosmetic purposes, inflammation, and wound healing. It has been used internally and externally and is believed to kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi, to possess local anesthetic, antiulcer, and anti-inflammatory properties, and to lower blood pressure and stimulate the immune system.Propolis exhibits antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria, yeasts, and some viruses. Commonly used in oral and dental preparations, propolis may have a role in reducing tooth decay and oral ulcers and in promoting the health of injured teeth. Cytotoxicity of propolis and its chemical constituents has been demonstrated to stop the growth of tumor in animals and tumor cell; however, clinical studies in human cancer are lacking. Immune system effects, antioxidant actions, and effects on the heart have also been described.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is limited clinical evidence to support specific dosage recommendations for propolis.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Allergic reactions with skin and mucous membrane irritations have been reported. Sensitization to propolis also has been reported.
Toxicology
Information regarding toxicology is lacking.

What is Reishi Mushroom?



The reishi mushroom is a purplish-brown fungus with a long stalk, brown spores, and a fan-shaped cap with a shiny, varnish-coated appearance. Reishi grows on decaying wood or tree stumps, preferring the Japanese plum tree but also found on oak. The mushroom is native to China, Japan, and North America but is cultivated throughout other Asian countries. Cultivation of reishi is a long, complicated process. The reishi grows in 6 colors, each thought to have different characteristics and known as: Aoshiba (blue reishi), Akashiba (red reishi), Kishiba (yellow reishi), Shiroshiba (white reishi), Kuroshiba (black reishi), and Murasakishiba (purple reishi).
Scientific Name(s)
Ganoderma lucidum (Leysser ex Fr.) Karst. Family: Polyporaceae.

Reishi's use is documented in the oldest Chinese medical text, which is more than 2,000 years old. Cultivation of reishi began in the 1980s. A survey conducted in Hong Kong found G. lucidum to be the third most common herbal preparation taken by preoperative surgical patients.General usesThe polysaccharide content of reishi mushroom is responsible for possible anticancer and immunostimulatory effects. Reishi may also provide hepatoprotective action, antiviral activity, and beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and diabetes. Few clinical trials have been conducted.
What is the recommended dosage?
The Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China recommends 6 to 12 g reishi extract daily. Ganopoly (a Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide extract) in doses up to 5.4 g daily (equivalent to 81 g of the fruiting body) for 12 weeks has been used in a few clinical trials.

What is Rosemary?



Rosemary grows as a small evergreen shrub with thick aromatic leaves. The plant has small, pale-blue flowers that bloom in late winter and early spring. Although rosemary is native to the Mediterranean, it now is cultivated worldwide. Other types of rosemary include bog rosemary (Andromeda species) and wild or marsh rosemary (Ledum palustre).
Scientific Name(s)
Rosmarinus officinalis
Common Name(s)
Rosemary also is known as old man.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesRosemary is a widely used culinary spice. Tradition holds that rosemary will grow only in gardens of households where the ""mistress"" is truly the ""master."" The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent, tonic, carminative, antispasmodic, and diaphoretic properties. Rosemary is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs, used centuries ago to enhance mental function and memory. Extracts and the volatile oil have been used to promote menstrual flow and as abortives. Rosemary extracts commonly are found as cosmetic ingredients and a lotion of the plant is said to stimulate hair growth and prevent baldness.Miscellaneous usesRosemary is a known antimicrobial agent. The powdered leaves are used as an effective natural flea and tick repellent. Rosemary oil possesses marked antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Rosemary oil was found to be most active against ""meat-spoiling"" bacteria. A report on the use of rosemary to treat head lice found it to be ineffective.There are numerous reports available evaluating rosemary's anticancer effects. The extract induces an anticarcinogenic enzyme. Other anticancer mechanisms include polyphenol constituents that inhibit metabolic activation of procarcinogens. Rosemary has been reported to decrease capillary permeability and fragility. The plant may have spasmolytic actions, liver, and immune effects. Rosemary also may reverse headaches, reduce stress, and aid in asthma and bronchitis treatment. Rosemary also is used in aromatherapy for chronic pain treatment. Several reports exist concerning rosemary's antioxidative actions. Rosemary antioxidants have less scavenging potential than green tea polyphenols, but have more potential than vitamin E.While research is promising, more clinical testing will need to be done to validate all the medicinal uses of rosemary.
What is the recommended dosage?
Rosemary leaf was approved for dyspepsia, high blood pressure, and rheumatism by the German Commission E at doses of 4 to 6 g/day. The essential oil has been used at doses of 0.1 to 1 mL.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Generally recognized as safe when used as food. Avoid dosages above those found in food because safety and efficacy are unproven. Known to have emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) and abortive effects.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Ingestion of large quantities of rosemary may result in stomach and intestinal irritation, and kidney damage. Allergic contact dermatitis has been associated with the plant, but rosemary is not generally considered to be a human skin sensitizer. Rosemary's constituents, monoterpene ketones, are convulsants, and have caused seizures in large doses. Rosemary also is an abortive.
Toxicology
Ingestion of large quantities of the oil may be associated with toxicity.

What is Royal Jelly?



Royal jelly is a milky-white secretion produced by glands of worker honeybees to induce the superior growth and development of the queen bee. Royal jelly is the principal food of the honeybee queen.
Scientific Name(s)
Produced by the honeybee, Apis mellifera L.
Common Name(s)
Royal jelly
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBecause of their specialized nutrition, queen bees differ from workers in several ways. The queens are approximately twice the size, they lay approximately 2,000 eggs a day (female worker bees are infertile), and they live 5 to 8 years (approximately 40 times longer than worker bees).These differences have led to the marketable assumption that ingestion of this product will do as much for humans as it does for bees; that is, increase size, improve fertility, and enhance longevity. In many countries, royal jelly has been promoted widely as a commercially available medicine, health food, and as a cosmetic (as an emollient, moisturizer, and nourishing substance). It is used in traditional medicine for longevity in Europe and Asia. Royal jelly has been sold as a skin tonic and hair growth stimulant.General usesRoyal jelly has been studied for a variety of actions, including antibiotic, antitumor, lowering blood pressure, and regulating the immune system. Additionally, effects on cholesterol, insulin-like action, and on the nervous system and female hormonal activity have been demonstrated. However, clinical trials are lacking.
What is the recommended dosage?
Clinical trials are generally lacking in the doses recommended. Small clinical trials have used 6 to 10 g royal jelly per day for 14 to 28 days in trials evaluating the effect on cholesterol.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not been identified. Allergy to bee venom is considered a relative contraindication.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Royal jelly has some effect on female hormonal activity.
Interactions
Case reports of blood in the urine due to increased effect of warfarin have been documented.
Side Effects
In many allergy patients, skin tests were positive for royal jelly. There have been case reports of allergy, increased effects on asthma, hypersensitivity, and death.
Toxicology
Data are limited.

213,Saffron,"
Saffron
What is Saffron?



True saffron is native to Asia Minor and southern Europe. Its blue-violet, lily-shaped flowers contain orange stigmas (part of the pistil) and red style branches, which are collected to produce the spice saffron. Mature stigmas are collected by hand during a short blooming season. More than 200,000 dried stigmas, obtained from about 70,000 flowers, yield 0.5 kg of true saffron. Saffron commands as much as  per ounce in the American market.True saffron should not be confused with American saffron (safflower, Indian safflower), Carthamus tinctorius (family Asteraceae), that is produced from the tubular florets and is a lighter red than true saffron. The 2 often are used for the same purposes, and the less expensive American saffron sometimes is used to adulterate true saffron.
Scientific Name(s)
Crocus sativus
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesSaffron has been used widely for flavoring food and as a dye for cloth, which it continues to be used for in underdeveloped countries and among back-to-basics artisans. Folkloric uses of saffron included its use as a sedative, expectorant, aphrodisiac, and diaphoretic (to induce perspiration). Anecdotal reports from the tropical regions of Asia describe the use of a paste composed of sandalwood and saffron as a soothing balm for dry skin. During the 16th through the 19th centuries, saffron was used in various opioid preparations for pain relief. Laudanum contained sherry wine, opium, saffron, cinnamon, and cloves. Black-drop contained opium, nutmeg, saffron, and yeast.Miscellaneous usesSaffron may possess antitumor activity. Chemopreventive (cancer preventive) studies examining the efficacy of saffron need to be performed. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of saffron for contraception or anti-inflammatory effects.
What is the recommended dosage?
Abortive dose equals 10 g, lethal dose equals 20 g.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) and abortive effects. Large amounts (more than 5 g, which is greater than amounts used in food) have uterine stimulant and abortive effects. Information regarding use in lactation is unavailable. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Saffron has been implicated in 1 case of anaphylaxis and 15 cases of seasonable allergic symptoms.
Toxicology
Saffron is not generally associated with toxicity when ingested in culinary amounts.

Sarsaparilla
What is Sarsaparilla?



Sarsaparilla is a woody, trailing vine that can grow to 50 m in length. Many Smilax species are similar in appearance, regardless of origin. The root of the plant is used for medicinal purposes, and the nectar-rich flowers are used in honey production. This root has a pleasant fragrance and spicy sweet taste, and has been used as a natural flavoring agent in medicines, foods, and nonalcoholic beverages. It should not be confused with the sassafras tree, which has the distinctive flavoring of American root beer.
Scientific Name(s)
Smilax species including Smilax aristolochiifolia (Mexican sarsaparilla), Smilax china, Salvia officinalis (Honduras sarsaparilla), Smilax regelii (Honduras, Jamaican sarsaparilla), Smilax febrifuga (Ecuadorian sarsaparilla), Smilax ornata.
Common Name(s)
Sarsaparilla also is known as Ba Qia catbrier, greenbrier, smilax, smilace, sarsa, Jin Gang Teng, Rhizoma Smilacis Glabrae, zarzaparilla, and khao yen.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe Spanish physician Nicholas Monardes described using sarsaparilla to treat syphilis in 1574. In 1812, Portuguese soldiers suffering from syphilis recovered faster if sarsaparilla was taken to treat the disease instead of mercury, the standard treatment at the time. Sarsaparilla has been used by many cultures for other ailments as well, including skin problems, arthritis, fever, digestive disorders, leprosy, and cancer. Late 15th century accounts explaining the identification and the first descriptions of American drugs include sarsaparilla. Sarsaparilla's role as a medicinal plant in American and European remedies in the 16th century also is evident.Sarsaparilla has been used for treating syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) throughout the world and was documented as an add-on treatment for leprosy in 1959.General usesExtracts of the roots may be effective in treating gout and metabolic syndrome (a combination of conditions, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol); however, evidence is based largely on animal studies and clinical trials are limited. Sarsaparilla has been traditionally used for treating syphilis, leprosy, and psoriasis; however, evidence to support these uses is lacking. Interest in cell-killing potential in treating cancer exists.
What is the recommended dosage?
Clinical trials are lacking to provide dosages. Typical doses of sarsaparilla for a variety of uses range from 0.3 to 2 g/day of the powdered root.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
GI irritation and increased urination have been reported. Clinical studies are lacking to provide evidence (or lack of evidence) of harm.
Toxicology
Information regarding toxicology with the use of sarsaparilla is limited.

Sarsaparilla has been used for treating syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) throughout the world for 40 years. It has been used for psoriasis, and was documented as an adjuvant for leprosy treatment in 1959.
Miscellaneous uses
The ability of sarsaparilla to bind to endotoxins may be a possible mechanism of action as to how the plant exerts its effects. Problems associated with high endotoxin levels circulating in the blood stream such as liver disease, psoriasis, fevers, and inflammatory processes, all seem to improve with sarsaparilla. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sarsaparilla for anti-inflammatory effects. A recent review addresses smilax compounds present in bodybuilding supplements said to “enhance performance.” Results of the study of more than 600 commercially available supplements determined that there was no research to validate these claims.
What is the recommended dosage?
Typical doses of sarsaparilla for a variety of uses range from 0.3 to 2 g/day of the powdered root.

What is Sassafras?



Sassafras is the name applied to 3 species of trees, 2 native to eastern Asia and 1 native to eastern North America. Fossils show that sassafras once was widespread in Europe, North America, and Greenland. All parts of the tree are strongly aromatic. The drug is from the peeled root of the plant (root bark). Synonyms are S. officinale and S. variifolium.
Scientific Name(s)
Sassafras albidum
Common Name(s)
Sassafras also is known as saxifras, ague tree, cinnamon wood, and saloop.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesNative Americans have used sassafras for centuries and told early settlers that it would cure a variety of illnesses. The settlers then exported it to Europe, where it was found ineffective. A report on experiences of explorers and doctors finding, identifying, and describing sassafras bark and other drugs during the late 16th century is available.Over the years, the oil obtained from the roots and wood has been used as a scent in perfumes and soaps. Medicinally, sassafras has been applied to insect bites and stings to relieve symptoms. The leaves and pith, when dried and powdered, have been used as a thickener in soups. The roots often are dried and steeped for tea, and sassafras formerly was used as a flavoring in root beer. The pleasant-tasting oil of sassafras comes from the roots and the root bark. The main constituent of the oil is safrole. Sassafras oil and safrole have been banned for use as a drug and as flavors and food additives by the FDA because of their carcinogenic potential. However, their use and sale persist throughout the US.
What is the recommended dosage?
Sassafras root bark has been used as an aromatic and carminative at doses of 10 g; however, the carcinogenicity of its constituent safrole has limited its use.
Contraindications
No longer considered safe.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented emmenagogue, abortifacient effects. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Besides being a cancer-causing agent, sassafras can induce vomiting, stupor, and hallucinations. It also can cause abortion, diaphoresis, and dermatitis.
Toxicology
Sassafras oil and safrole have been banned for use as flavors and food additives by the FDA because of their carcinogenic potential.

What is Scullcap?



Scullcap (S. laterifolia), a member of the mint family, is native to the US where it grows in moist woods. Although it is widely distributed throughout large regions of North America, there are related species found as far away as China. Scullcap is an erect perennial with bluish flower. Official compendia (eg, NF VI) recognized only the dried overground portion of the plant as useful; however, some herbal texts listed all parts as medicinal. A number of species have been used medicinally, and the most common European variety has been S. baicalensis, a native of East Asia.
Scientific Name(s)
Scutellaria laterifolia
Common Name(s)
Scullcap also is known as skullcap, helmetflower, hoodwort, and mad-dog weed.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesScullcap appears to have been introduced into traditional American medicine toward the end of the 1700s, when it was promoted as an effective treatment for the management of hydrophobia (hence the derivation of one of its common names). It later was used as a tonic, particularly in proprietary remedies for ""female weakness."" The plant had been reputed to be an herbal tranquilizer, particularly in combination with Valerian, but has fallen into disuse. Scullcap has traditionally been used to treat nervousness, irritability, and neuralgia, as well as for its sedative properties.Miscellaneous usesOne clinical study indicates some anti-anxiety properties of scullcap. Recent studies also suggest that it might have anti-inflammatory activity. The depressant and antihypertensive effects of scullcap also have been looked at in a few small animal studies with no conclusive results. Teas prepared from Scutellaria species have demonstrable antibacterial and antifungal activity.
What is the recommended dosage?
Limit the doses of American skullcap to no more than the package recommendation. Typical doses (see individual product information): Dried herb– 1 to 2 g 3 times/day; tea– 240 mL 3 times/day (pour 250 mL of boiling water over 5 to 10 mL of the dried herb and steep for 10 to 15 min); tincture– 2 to 4 mL 3 times/day.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects in pregnancy. Avoid use. May inhibit pituitary and chorionic gonadotropins, as well as prolactin.
Interactions
None well documented, although it may exaggerate the effects of other drugs that cause drowsiness.
Side Effects
If taken according to the manufacturer's directions, scullcap does not seem to exhibit any adverse effects.
Toxicology
An overdose of the tincture causes giddiness, stupor, confusion, twitching of the limbs, intermission of the pulse, and other symptoms of epilepsy.

What is Seaweed?



Seaweeds are marine algae, saltwater-dwelling, simple plants, including red, brown, and green algae. Most algae have root-like structures called holdfasts that anchor the plant to rocks and other substrates. While blue-green species are called algae, they are actually bacteria.
Scientific Name(s)
More than 9,000 species exist, including Ascophyllum, Chondrus, Ecklonia, Fucus, Gelidium, Gracilaria, Laminaria, Phaeophycota, Pterocladia, and Rhodophyceae.
Common Name(s)
Seaweed is also known as brown seaweed, red seaweed, algae, kelp, egg wrack, kombu/konbu, sea spaghetti, wakame, nori, dulse/dillisk, sea lettuce, sea grass, carrageenin, and Irish moss.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesFor centuries, seaweed has been of botanical, industrial, and pharmaceutical interest. Because of the high nutrient content, seaweed has been used as a food throughout Asia.Traditional Chinese medicine used hot water extracts of certain seaweeds in the treatment of cancer. Additionally, the Japanese and Chinese cultures have used seaweeds to treat goiter and other glandular problems since 300 BC.The Romans used seaweeds in the treatment of wounds, burns, and rashes. The Celts noted that ordinary seaweed contracted as it dried and then expanded with moisture. In Scotland during the 18th century, physicians used dried seaweed stem to successfully drain abdominal wall abscesses. They also inserted seaweed into the cervix in an attempt to treat dysmenorrhea. Many reports outline the use of seaweed to induce abortion. Seaweed was employed intravaginally for ripening of the cervix and was used rectally for strictures.General usesThere are few clinical trials to support therapeutic recommendations for seaweeds. However, seaweeds are an important source of minerals and are low in sodium. They may be useful in heart conditions due to cholesterol reduction and appetite suppression. Alginates extracted from seaweed have been used in wound dressings.
What is the recommended dosage?
Clinical trials have used an oral dosage range of 4 to 12 g seaweed daily for up to 2 months.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
Patients taking warfarin and consuming a large quantity of food containing seaweed may experience a change in international normalized ratio because of seaweed's high vitamin K content.
Side Effects
Skin reaction, goiter, and, occasionally, intestinal effects may occur.
Toxicology
Excessive intake of dried seaweed may result in increased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. There have been case reports of yellowing of the skin with excessive seaweed consumption.

What is Shark Derivatives?



Shark cartilage is prepared from the cartilage of freshly caught sharks in the Pacific Ocean. The cartilage is cut from the shark, cleaned, shredded, and dried. One of the main processing plants for dogfish shark is in Costa Rica. The finely ground cartilage is uniformly pulverized (in a 200 mesh screen), sterilized, and encapsulated.Squalamine originally was isolated from shark stomachs, but has subsequently been synthesized. This compound is still in the experimental stage and is not yet commercially available.
Scientific Name(s)
Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish shark), Sphyrna lewini (Hammerhead shark) and other shark species.
What is it used for?
AnticancerEarly claims were made that extracts of shark cartilage inhibited tumors. The rationale includes the fact that sharks rarely get cancer, that sharks are cartilaginous fish and that cartilage is avascular (without blood vessels) and contains agents that inhibit vascularization (blood vessel genesis). The reasoning then follows that sharks do not get cancer because the inhibited vascularization prevents the formation of tumors. Hence, giving it to humans may inhibit tumor angiogenesis and cure cancer.The active principle(s) has not been found, although some believe it might be a protein. The shark cartilage was thought to be a cancer control agent. Several studies have been done on various sharks, but none have proven this theory. Clinical studies must be undertaken to prove any of the anticancer effects of shark derivatives.Other usesSqualamine has been used as a potent antibiotic with fungicidal and antiprotozoal activity.
What is the recommended dosage?
A standardized shark cartilage product has been marketed under the name Neovastat (AE-941). Clinical trials in cancer angiogenesis have used doses of 60 to 240 mL daily, while another trial of a liquid shark cartilage product used only 7 to 21 mL daily.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Research reveals little or no information regarding adverse reactions with the use of shark derivatives.
Toxicology
Research reveals little or no information regarding toxicology with the use of shark derivatives.

Shark Liver Oil
What is Shark Liver Oil?



SLO is commercially produced from several species of deep sea sharks' livers. SLO is a major natural source of squalene, a natural organic compound, and alkyglycerols, compounds that may fight cancer.
Scientific Name(s)
Shark liver oil (SLO) is obtained from several species of sharks, including the deep sea shark (Centrophorus squamosus), the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias), and the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus).
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn 1916, squalene was isolated from SLO. Initially, SLO was used by Scandinavian fishermen to treat skin conditions, lung ailments, and certain cancers. The oil has been historically used to treat what was referred to as ""glandular disease"" that today most likely would be called lymphadenopathy. The active components alkylglycerols have been studied in a number of areas, including to stimulate the immune system.General usesSLO has been used to help treat cancer, skin conditions, and respiratory ailments, as well as to reduce recurrent mouth ulcers and prevent radiation sickness. However, limited clinical data are available. Alkylglycerols have been studied as an immune system stimulant. Animal data suggest SLO may improve fertility.
What is the recommended dosage?
SLO marketed under the name isolutrol has been studied in a clinical trial of acne at a topical concentration of 0.15 g per 100 mL.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Few toxic effects have been reported. SLO supplements may have an unpleasant taste and/or odor. There have been reports of SLO-induced pneumonia in humans and pigs.
Toxicology
No adverse reactions or effects on mortality were noted in rats receiving short- and long-term doses of a fluid extract of SLO at doses 100 to 200 times that of normal human consumption. In Sweden, a SLO product (Ecomer) was prohibited for use by the National Board of Health and Welfare because of suspected negative effects.

What is Slippery Elm?



The slippery elm tree is native to eastern Canada and eastern and central US, where it is found most commonly in the Appalachian mountains. The trunk is reddish brown with gray-white bark on the branches. In the spring, dark brown floral buds appear and open into small, clustered flowers at the branch tips. White elm (U. americana) is a related species used in a similar manner.
Scientific Name(s)
Ulmus rubra. Also known as U. fulva.
Common Name(s)
Slippery elm also is known as red elm, Indian elm, moose elm, and sweet elm.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesNorth American Indians and early settlers used the inner bark of the slippery elm not only to build canoes, shelter, and baskets, but as a poultice or as a soothing drink. Upon contact with water, the inner bark, collected in spring, yields a thick mucilage or demulcent that was used as an ointment or salve to treat urinary tract inflammation and was applied topically for cold sores and boils. A decoction of the leaves was used as a poultice to remove discoloration around blackened or bruised eyes. Surgeons during the American Revolution treated gun-shot wounds in this manner. Early settlers boiled bear fat with the bark to prevent rancidity. Late in the 19th century, a preparation of elm mucilage was officially recognized in the United States Pharmacopoeia.Demulcent/ProtectantSlippery elm prepared as a poultice coats and protects irritated tissues such as skin or intestinal membranes. The powdered bark has been used in this manner for local application to treat gout, rheumatism, cold sores, wounds, abscesses, ulcers, and toothaches. The tannins present are known to possess astringent actions. It also has been known to ""draw out"" toxins, boils, splinters, or other irritants.Powdered bark is incorporated into lozenges to provide demulcent action (soothing to mucous membranes) in the treatment of throat irritation. It also is used for its emollient and antitussive actions, to treat bronchitis and other lung afflictions, and to relieve thirst.GI/Urogenital effectsWhen slippery elm preparations are taken internally, they cause reflex stimulation of nerve endings in the GI tract, leading to mucus secretion. This may be the reason they are effective for protection against stomach ulcers, colitis, diverticulitis, gut inflammation, and acidity. Slippery elm also is useful for diarrhea, constipation, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome, and to expel tapeworms. It also has been used to treat cystitis and urinary inflammations.Other usesThe plant also is used as a lubricant to ease labor, as a source of nutrition for convalescence or baby food preparations, and for its activity against herpes and syphilis.
What is the recommended dosage?
Slippery elm inner bark has been used for treatment of ulcers at doses of 1.5 to 3 g/day. It is commonly decocted with ethyl alcohol. No formal clinical studies support this dosage.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented abortive effects. Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Extracts from slippery elm have caused contact dermatitis, and the pollen has been reported to be allergenic.
Toxicology
The FDA has declared slippery elm to be a safe and effective oral demulcent.

228,SOD,"
SOD
What is SOD?



Superoxide dismutase (SOD, orgotein) is an ubiquitous enzyme that has received attention because of its therapeutic activity and because of claims that its ingestion may improve health and lengthen the human lifespan. At least 3 distinct types of the enzyme are found in humans and other mammals.A highly reactive superoxide free radical is generated as a toxic metabolite in a wide range of normal biological reactions that reduce oxygen. Since the superoxide radical is toxic to normal living cells, the enzyme superoxide dismutase, which is present in all cells, catalyzes the conversion of superoxide to the harmless components oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.
Scientific Name(s)
Superoxide dismutase, orgotein
What is it used for?
Anti-inflammatoryWhite blood cells involved in the acute inflammatory response release large amounts of superoxide, which appears to contribute to the destruction of bacteria. Similarly, the amount of superoxide released at the site of an inflamed joint has been shown to cause extensive and rapid degradation of synovial fluid. SOD generally protects the fluid against this degradation. Furthermore, it protects the leucocytes themselves from free radical damage.Although IV infusion of SOD has little anti-inflammatory activity because of its rapid renal clearance, the local injection of SOD has proven to be an effective treatment for a variety of inflammatory disorders.Superoxide has been successfully used to treat human inflammatory diseases. In West Germany, where orgotein has been in general medical use for years, the drug is injected locally for the management of osteoarthritis, sports injuries, and knee joint osteoarthritis.SOD has been used for the treatment of soft tissue inflammation in horses and dogs, human inflammatory diseases, and chronic bladder inflammations. SOD is obtained for clinical use through genetically engineered biotechnology sources.Other usesSeveral reports have described an association between free radicals and aging. One researcher suggested that lifespans could be increased by 5 to 10 years by reducing body weight and increasing the levels of free-radical scavengers such as ascorbic acid, selenium and alpha-tocopherol. Some data indicate that longer-lived animal species have a higher internal degree of protection against free radicals.Based on such reports, some health food manufacturers have promoted products containing SOD as a nutritional supplement. These oral supplements have been said to remove wrinkles and age lines, slow the aging process, and facilitate a longer, healthier life.There are no published data to support these claims. SOD is a labile enzyme that is degraded rapidly by gastric acids when ingested. It is essentially unabsorbed after oral administration even when enteric coated, and confers no pharmacologic activity when taken orally. While many foods (red meats, vegetables) are rich in SOD, their SOD is degraded when ingested and is rendered enzymatically inactive.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is a single clinical trial in which SOD was administered intratracheally in premature infants. Injection of SOD in 8 to 32 mg doses has been reported. Most clinical trials of SOD have measured its level as an outcome, rather than a treatment.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Avoid use.
Interactions
Not documented.
Side Effects
The main complaint seems to be pain at the injection site.
Toxicology
SOD has been recognized as a remarkably nontoxic compound.

What is Stevia?



Stevia is a perennial shrub indigenous to northern South America, but commercially grown in areas such as Central America, Israel, Thailand, and China. The leaves are the parts of the plant used. Stevia is a member of the daisy (Asteraceae) family.
Scientific Name(s)
Stevia rebaudiana
Common Name(s)
Stevia also is known as Sweet Leaf of Paraguay, Caa-he-é, Ca-a-yupi, Eira-caa, and Capim doce.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesStevia has been used to sweeten tea for centuries, dating back to the Guarani Indians of South America. For hundreds of years, native Brazilians and Paraguayans also have employed the leaves of the plant as a sweetening agent. Europeans learned about stevia in the 16th century, whereas North American interest in the plant began in the 20th century when researchers heard of its sweetening properties. Paraguayan botanist Moises Bertoni documented stevia in the early 1900s. Glycosides responsible for the plant's sweetness were discovered in 1931. Stevia extracts are used today as food additives in Japan and Brazil as a non-caloric sweetener. In the US, however, use is limited to supplement status only.Sweetening agentStevia has been used for centuries as a natural sweetener. The plant contains sweet glycosides (eg, stevioside), with the most intense sweetness belonging to the species S. rebaudina. Stevia as a sweetening agent works well in weight-loss programs to satisfy ""sugar cravings,"" and is low in calories. The Japanese are the largest consumers of stevia leaves and employ the plant to sweeten foods, such as soy sauce, confections, and soft drinks, as a replacement for aspartame and saccharin.Other usesIn addition to its use as a sweetening agent, stevia also has been found to have hypotensive, hypoglycemic, and bactericidal properties. However, research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of stevia for any condition.

Taheebo
What is Taheebo?



Tabebuia is a large genus of tropical trees that grows worldwide. According to one source, the correct name for the source species is T. impetiginosa; however, the majority of biological and chemical studies of the plant refer to T. avellaneda.

It has a hard, durable, and attractive wood that is extremely resistant to insect and fungal attack.
Scientific Name(s)

However, there is sufficient scientific proof to support this use. Antifungal and antibiotic properties also are claimed in promotional literature, with topical and oral dosing for candidiasis. While taheebo shows some promise, no clinical trials have been conducted for any indication.
What is the recommended dosage?
Taheebo bark has been used as an alternative cancer treatment. However, there are no clinical studies to support a specific dose.
Contraindications
Do not use taheebo with anticoagulants.
Pregnancy/Lactation

What is Vitamin E?



Vitamin E is a generic term for a group of tocol and tocotrienol derivatives. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that exists in a variety of forms in many foods (eg, spinach, nuts, sunflower seeds, olives, asparagus, vegetable oils, mangoes, wheat germ, whole-wheat breads). The most common form in a Western diet is alpha-tocopherol. The most important chemical characteristic is its antioxidant property, which in foods, blocks the addition of oxygen to fats, causing rancidity. In the body, antioxidants may prevent formation of reactive oxygen species, which can cause damage to proteins and DNA in tissues.
Scientific Name(s)
Alpha-tocopherol
Common Name(s)
Vitamin E
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesVitamin E was discovered in 1922 when reproductive abnormalities in rats reared on a basic diet were cured by a substance isolated from vegetable oils. A pure fraction was chemically identified in 1938 and named tocopherol after the Greek words tokos and phero meaning ""child birth"" and ""to bring forth.""General usesRoutine use of high-dose vitamin E for cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and epilepsy is not recommended. Vitamin E supplementation may have a role in treating age-related macular degeneration, dysmenorrhea, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis, and tardive dyskinesia. Topical use of vitamin E has been investigated for the reduction of scarring.
What is the recommended dosage?
Dosages in clinical trials range from 400 to 1,600 units/day. The established safe upper limit is 1,000 mg/day (1,500 units/day), but due to findings from meta-analyses, a lower safe dosage of 150 to 200 units/day has been suggested.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been identified.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Trials have been conducted in pregnant women (see Uses and Pharmacology). The majority of trials report no increase in negative fetal outcome, but results regarding birth-weight are conflicting. Considering the evidence of harm (all-cause mortality), high-dose vitamin E supplementation should be used with caution. Natural food sources are preferred.
Interactions
Orlistat may reduce vitamin E absorption. Vitamin E may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and may decrease the benefits of atorvastatin therapy.
Side Effects
Meta-analyses of trials investigating high-dose vitamin E supplementation have found evidence of harm. Low-dose vitamin E supplementation (150 mg/day) does not appear to have any serious adverse reactions. High doses of vitamin E may prolong bleeding time.
Toxicology
Vitamin E is a known antioxidant. However, it may also act as a pro-oxidant, causing oxidation and consequent damage to cells. The use of high-dose vitamin E supplementation may increase the risk of cancer in certain populations and also increase mortality.

Walnut
What is Walnut?



There are about 15 species of Juglans (walnut genus); commercially, J. regia is the most important. This deciduous tree can grow to 45 m in height. J. regia is native to Asia but is cultivated now in France and other parts of Europe, North Africa, North America, and East Asia.
Scientific Name(s)
Juglans regia L. Family: Juglandaceae
Common Name(s)
Walnut, English walnut, Persian walnut, Caucasian walnut, Circassian walnut, and European walnut.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesWalnuts have been found in prehistoric deposits in Europe dating from the Iron Age and are mentioned in Old Testament references to King Solomon's nut garden. Many legends have been associated with the walnut; the ancient Greeks and Romans regarded them as symbols of fertility. In the Middle Ages, walnuts were thought to ward off witchcraft, the evil eye, and epileptic fits because of the belief that evil spirits lurked in the walnut branches.Historically, walnut oil was prescribed for colic, to soothe intestines, and to relieve diarrhea and hemorrhoids. Further folk uses include treating rickets, frostbite, and glandular disturbances, and as an astringent, tonic restorative, and disinfectant. Blisters, ulcers, itchy scalp/dandruff, sunburn, and perspiration are some of the conditions treated with various walnut preparations.General usesThe inclusion of walnuts in the diet is recommended as a dietary source of polyunsaturated fatty acids and other nutrients, and to improve the lipid profile in hyperlipidemic individuals. Cardiac benefits of walnut consumption are described. Walnuts have also been studied in metabolic syndrome with limited benefit demonstrated. The effect of walnut extract in Alzheimer disease is being investigated.
What is the recommended dosage?
Daily dosages used in clinical trials range from 20 to 84 g/day (1 shelled walnut is approximately 5 g).
Contraindications
Contraindications have not been identified. Cross-hypersensitivity between tree nuts is known to exist.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Generally recognized as safe when used as food. The possibility of in utero sensitization has been debated without conclusion.
Interactions
None well documented. Walnut interferes with the absorption of iron.
Side Effects
Allergy and fatal anaphylaxis to walnut have been reported.
Toxicology
Information is lacking. Juglone, a constituent of walnut, is toxic in animals.

Wintergreen
What is Wintergreen?



Wintergreen is a perennial evergreen shrub that is native to eastern North America, and usually is found in woodland and exposed mountainous areas. Its small, waxy, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late summer, developing a red fruit. The leaves and fruits are edible.
Scientific Name(s)
Gaultheria procumbens
Common Name(s)
Wintergreen is also known as teaberry, checkerberry, gaultheria oil, boxberry, deerberry, mountain tea, and Canada tea.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAmerican Indians reportedly used wintergreen for treating back pain, rheumatism, fever, headaches, and sore throats. The plant and its oil have been used in traditional medicine as a pain releiver, for indigesion, and to protect the skin and reduce bleeding from minor cuts.Steam processing of the warmed, water-treated leaves produces wintergreen oil. It is used with sweet birch oil or a chemical compound (typically no more than 0.04%) for flavoring foods and candy.Wintergreen berries have been used to make pies. A tea made from the leaves was used as a substitute for black tea during the Revolutionary War. The tea has been used to relieve cold symptoms and muscle aches.General usesIn addition to being used as a flavoring, wintergreen and its oil have been used on the skin in preparations for the treatment of muscular and rheumatic pain. Clinical data do not support the use of wintergreen for any condition.
What is the recommended dosage?

What is Witch Hazel?



Witch hazel is a deciduous bush or small tree reaching about 6 m in height found in damp woods throughout most of North America. It has broad, toothed oval leaves, and golden yellow flowers. Brown fruit capsules appear after the flowers. The dried leaves, bark, and twigs are used.
Scientific Name(s)
Hamamelis viginiana
Common Name(s)
Witch hazel is also known as Cortex Hamamelis (dried bark), Folium Hamamelis (dried or fresh leaves), Hamamelis, Hamamelis water, magician's rod, snapping hazel, spotted alder, tobacco wood, white hazel, andwinter bloom.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesWitch hazel is a widely known plant with a lengthy history of use in the Americas. The plant, including the crude leaf and bark, is used in a variety of forms; fluid extracts, poultices, and most commonly as witch hazel water. The latter, also known as Hamamelis water or distilled witch hazel extract, is obtained from recently cut, partially dormant twigs. This plant material is soaked in warm water, followed by distillation and the addition of alcohol to the distillate. Witch hazel water is the most commonly found commercial preparation, usually kept in most homes as a topical cooling agent or astringent.Traditionally, witch hazel was known to native North American people as a treatment for tumors and eye inflammations. It was used internally for bleeding. Other uses include treatment of hemorrhoids, burns, cancers, tuberculosis, colds, and fever. Preparations have been used on the skin for treatment of itching and inflammation, as well as in preparations for eye irritation.General usesWitch hazel preparations are commonly used for skin conditions, including diaper rash; however, clinical studies supporting these uses are generally lacking. Witch hazel has been evaluated for antioxidant and antitumor activity.
What is the recommended dosage?
TopicalSteam distillates of Hamamelis are used diluted (1:3 with water) or undiluted, and in semisolid preparations at 5% to 10% of crude drug.RectalSuppositories containing witch hazel contain from 0.1 to 1 g/dose.OralNot recommended.
Contraindications
Internal use is not recommended because of the high tannin content.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Allergic skin reactions have been reported from topical applications.
Toxicology
Although extracts of witch hazel are available commercially, they shouldn't be taken internally because the toxicity of the tannins has not been well defined.

Scientific Name(s)
Achillea millefolium
Common Name(s)
Yarrow also is known as thousand-leaf, mil foil, green arrow, wound wort, and nosebleed plant.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesYarrow is native to Europe and Asia, and has been naturalized in North America. Its use in food and medicine is ancient, dating back to the Trojan War, around 1200 BC. In legend, Achilles used it on the Centaur's advice, hence the name. In classical times, yarrow was referred to as ""herba militaris"" because it stopped bleeding wounds received in war. Yarrow leaves have been used for tea, and young leaves and flowers have been used in salads. Infusions of yarrow have served as cosmetic cleansers and medicines.

It also has been reported to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and pain. It has been used to relieve GI ailments, for cerebral and coronary thromboses, to lower high blood pressure, to improve circulation, and to tone varicose veins. It has antimicrobial actions, is a natural source for food flavoring, and is used in alcoholic beverages and bitters. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of yarrow to treat any medical condition.
What is the recommended dosage?
A typical dose of yarrow herb is 4.5 g/day for inflammatory conditions. However, there are no modern clinical studies to validate this dose.
Contraindications
Yarrow is contraindicated in individuals with an existing hypersensitivity to any member of the Asteraceae family. Use in epileptic patients is contraindicated.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects. Emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow) and abortive. Avoid use of yarrow's volatile oil during pregnancy.

What is Yellow Dock?



Yellow dock is a perennial herb that, although native to Europe, grows throughout the United States. The yellow roots and rhizomes are used medicinally.
Scientific Name(s)
Rumex crispus
Common Name(s)
Yellow dock also is known as curly dock, curled dock, narrow dock, sour dock, and rumex.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe spring leaf stalks of this plant have been used as a potherb in salads but are disagreeable to some because of their tart sour-sweet taste. The plant must be boiled and rinsed thoroughly before being eaten. Due to its astringent properties, the plant has been used generally unsuccessfully in the treatment of venereal diseases and skin conditions. The powdered root has been used as a natural dentifrice. Larger amounts have been given as a laxative and tonic.While the roots of yellow dock are known to exert a laxative effect, research reveals no animal or clinical data regarding the use of yellow dock to treat any condition.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no recent clinical evidence to support specific dose recommendations for yellow dock. Caution is warranted due to oxalate content.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been determined.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Documented adverse effects; contains anthraquinones (laxative action). Avoid use.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
The oxalate content of the leaves may result in GI symptoms or kidney damage. The stewed leaf stalks can be eaten as a potherb, but mature and uncooked leaves should be avoided.
Toxicology
Overdose of the root may cause diarrhea, nausea, and polyuria (excessive urination).

Q & A

Common Name(s)
Yogurt
What is Yogurt?



Yogurt is the general term for a fermented, slightly acidic milk product that contains essentially no alcohol. Most commonly, it is prepared by the addition of live cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus to heated whole or skim cow's milk. The mixture is incubated and homogenized to a semisolid. Condensed skim milk or dry milk solids sometimes are added to produce a custard-like texture. If cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus are added, the product is called acidophilus milk. Yogurt provides a dietary source of calcium and protein, as well as folic acid, magnesium, and zinc.
What is it used for?
ProbioticYogurt has been promoted to restore the GI flora after systemic antibiotic therapy and to alleviate anal pruritus, aphthous ulcers, and canker sores. The large number of bacteria in active yogurt (each milliliter of commercial brands contains about 125 million L. bulgaricus and 125 million S. thermophilus) may hasten colonization in the colon, thereby removing the reservoir of yeast infection. More than 3 decades ago, bacterial replacement therapy with live cultures was found to have no established value in the prevention or treatment of such disorders. Yogurt possesses intrinsic antibacterial activity, probably largely because of its lactic acid content. Lactic acid has demonstrated bactericidal activity against some organisms, but this is probably not the only factor in eliminating the bacteria.Cardiovascular and cholesterol reduction effectsFat loss and weight loss have been demonstrated with the use of yogurt. Enhanced calcium intake was proposed as the mechanism for this effect. Older studies have demonstrated a cholesterol-lowering effect with yogurt. Surveys suggest yogurt has a protective effect against coronary heart disease and elevated blood pressure.OsteoporosisOne human clinical study showed that the addition of yogurt to the diet significantly reduced a marker of bone resorption in menopausal women. Despite the debate that exists regarding the role of supplemental calcium in the prevention of osteoporosis, yogurt remains a recommended source of calcium.Anticancer effectsYogurt also may have some anticancer properties. Yogurt has a protective effect against some cancers in laboratory experiments, but convincing human data are not available.Other usesYogurt has been used as a substitute for milk for those who are lactose intolerant. Yogurt has been at the center of a controversy regarding milk products that can be tolerated by people with lactase deficiency. Studies are inconclusive. Reports by those with lactose intolerance and other bowel disorders indicate individual responses that often vary from study results.Yogurt also has been used to prevent recurring vaginal yeast infections. There has been some interest in the direct vaginal instillation of yogurt for the treatment of Candida infections. However, the clinical effects of this therapy have not been defined in well-controlled studies, and this practice cannot be widely recommended, particularly in pregnant women.
What is the recommended dosage?
In addition to its widespread use as a food, yogurt has been studied in clinical trials in amounts of 100 to 200 g/day.
Contraindications
The use of yogurt containing live cultures (probiotic) is not advised in patients at risk for opportunistic infections or in those with badly damaged GI tracts.
Pregnancy/Lactation
Generally recognized as safe when used as food.
Interactions
None well documented.
Side Effects
Yogurt is not associated with any significant adverse reactions.
Toxicology
No data.

Yucca
What is Yucca?



The name yucca applies to as many as 40 species of trees and shrubs found mostly in arid portions of North America. The common names noted above can apply to different species. The Spanish bayonet is Y. aloifolia and Our Lord's candle is Y. whipplei. Other common yuccas include Y. schidigera (Mohave yucca) and Y. brevifolia (Joshua tree), which grows to 60 feet in height and commonly is found at the bases of desert mountains. Yucca plants are characterized by stiff, evergreen, sword-shaped leaves crowded on a stout trunk. There is a dense terminal flowerhead faintly resembling a candle. The flowers are white or greenish. All yucca plants depend for pollination on nocturnal yucca moths. Each variety of moth is adapted to a single species of yucca.
Scientific Name(s)
Yucca spp
Common Name(s)
Yucca also is known as Spanish bayonet, Our Lord's candle, Joshua tree, and Adam's needle.
What is it used for?
Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesFor centuries, yucca plants have served American Indians for a variety of uses including fiber for rope, sandals and cloth; the roots have been used in soap. The Indians and early Californian settlers used the green pods for food. Indian uses included boiling and baking the fruits, eating the blossoms, chewing the raw leaves and fermenting the fruits to produce a beverage for rituals.Miscellaneous usesThe plant has been purported to be beneficial for treating colitis, hypertension, arthritis, and migraine headaches. One report found that the oral administration of daily doses of a yucca saponin extract was effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of various arthritic conditions. Interestingly, these patients also had significant reductions in blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels, and a reduction in the incidence of migraine headaches from baseline. This limited evidence suggests the extract may be effective in the management of arthritis, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. More clinical research is needed. Yucca also has been used in soaps, shampoos, and food supplements. Yuccas contain saponins that have a long-lasting soaping action. A solid extract is derived from the leaves; the Mohave yucca is the most common commercially used plant. Current commercial uses of yucca extracts include foaming agents in carbonated beverages, flavorings, and for use in drug synthesis research.
What is the recommended dosage?
There is no recent clinical evidence upon which dosing recommendations for yucca can be based.
Contraindications
Contraindications have not yet been determined.
