0,5-Hydroxytryptophan,"
5-Hydroxytryptophan is also known as 5-HTP. It is used by some people to help with low mood or worry. Others may use it to help with sleep, headaches, menopausal symptoms, or to decrease appetite. Some people believe 5-HTP will help with alcoholism, drug withdrawal symptoms, or obesity. Others use it to help with Alzheimer's Disease, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's Disease, schizophrenia, or attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)."
1,Acai,"
Acai has been used by some people to help stop cell damage in the body."
2,Acerola,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAcerola is believed to originate from the yucatan. Traditionally, the fruits have been used to treat dysentery, diarrhea, and liver disorders. Other ethnobotanical uses include as an astringent and for fever.Vitamin supplementationBoth species of Malpighia have been reported to be excellent sources of vitamin C. However, the fruit of M. emarginata is known more accurately as acerola and is one of the richest sources of vitamin C. Acerola is used as a source of food and juice. Because of its high concentration of vitamin C, it also is sold as a natural health supplement. Acerola provides other useful vitamins and minerals. Acerola contains from 1 to 4.5 percent vitamin C (1,000 to 4,500 mg/100 g) in the edible portion of the fruit. This far exceeds the content of vitamin C in peeled oranges (about 0.05 or 50 mg/100 g). The content of vitamin C in acerola varies with ripeness (highest in green and lowest in fully ripened fruit). It also varies with the season and climate. Vitamin C analysis regarding acerola storage finds freezing the fruits to be the best way to preserve vitamin C, as compared with room temperature or refrigeration. In addition, acerola contains vitamin A (4,300 to 12,500 IU/100 g) at about the same level as in carrots. Other constituents include thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, and bioflavonoids. It also contains phosphorus, malic acid, pantothenic acid, potassium, and magnesium. The sugars dextrose, fructose, and sucrose are also present. Acerola analysis in another report finds protein, fiber, lipids, and fatty acids. Zinc and other minerals are present, as well. Vitamin C is an essential coenzyme that is required for normal metabolic function. Many animals can synthesize vitamin C from glucose; however, humans must obtain the vitamin totally from dietary sources. Deficiencies of this water-soluble vitamin result in scurvy. This is a potentially fatal disease with multisystem involvement. Dietary supplements have traditionally provided adequate protection against the development of this disease. However, controversy has focused on whether vitamin C derived from ""natural"" sources is more physiologic than that produced synthetically or semisynthetically (as ascorbic acid). To date, there is no clear evidence that naturally derived vitamin C is superior in its clinical effectiveness than synthetic ascorbic acid. There is a potential advantage to using acerola as a source of vitamin C. The advantage is that one receives not only ascorbic acid but also several other useful vitamins and minerals from the fruit. Whether this is superior to the use of a multiple vitamin preparation has not been determined. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of acerola for vitamin supplementation.AntioxidantVitamin C is known to strengthen the immune system and build collagen cells. It also supports the respiratory system. Vitamin C is known to be an effective antioxidant. The antioxidative qualities of acerola make it an ideal ingredient in skin care products to fight cellular aging. In another report, acerola extract was shown to enhance the antioxidant activity of soy and alfalfa extracts, acting synergistically. This may be beneficial in coronary artery disease.Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of acerola as an antioxidant."
3,Acetyl-L-Carnitine,"
Acetyl-L-carnitine is also known as ALC. It is used by some people with high blood sugar to help with cholesterol as well as nerve pain, such as tingling in their hands and feet. Others have used it to help stop cell damage. It may also help to improve appetite and increase energy levels. Some people use it to improve mood. People with blood vessel problems in their legs have used it to help them walk better and to walk with less pain. ALC may also help people with low carnitine levels to have a more normal level in their blood."
4,Acidophilus,"


Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
For several decades, health and nutritional benefits have been claimed for products containing Lactobacillus cultures. The topical or intravaginal application of yogurt products has been reported to control yeast and bacterial infections.
Replenish normal bacterial flora
L. acidophilus has been referred to as a probiotic, defined as microorganisms that have a beneficial effect on the host by improving the properties of the indigenous microflora. Products containing live cultures have been investigated for their ability to compete with pathogens in the microenvironment, thereby permitting the reestablishment of normal bacterial flora. Lactobacillus has long been considered to be a component of the protective flora in the vagina. Recently, Lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide have been found in normal vaginal flora. Consequently, the therapeutic benefits of Lactobacillus products have been investigated in women with vaginal and urinary tract infections. Its value in treating lower urinary tract infections remains unclear. Acidophilus has also been used to treat sore mouth caused by Candida infections. While some clinical studies are positive, more studies are needed to determine the exact therapeutic benefits of acidophilus.
GI uses
L. acidophilus is normally found in the human alimentary tract. Consequently, the oral administration of products containing L. acidophilus may be useful in the management of a variety of conditions associated with altered GI flora. Their beneficial effects may be related to the ability to suppress the growth of pathogens. Acidophilus also has been reported by laboratory findings to suppress the growth of C. pylori, implicated in acid-peptic disease. More clinical trials are necessary to validate these findings. The ingestion of yogurt products has been associated with decreases in the concentration of several fecal enzymes that have the capacity to convert procarcinogens to carginogens in the colon. This suggests that the consumption of Lactobacillus-containing products may have beneficial effects, although no further data are available to support this hypothesis.
Antibiotic-induced diarrhea
The ingestion of Lactobacillus preparations has been recommended to reduce the symptoms of antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Some clinical studies show that Lactobacillus-containing products help reduce the incidence of diarrhea, nausea, cramping, flatulence, and yeast superinfection with patients on antibiotics. Yet to date, no consensus has been reached regarding the effectiveness for this use. Acidophilus did not prevent travelers diarrhea in another clinical study.
Cholesterol control
Other reports have indicated that the ingestion of acidophilus-containing products can reduce serum cholesterol levels. Acidophilus bacteria have the ability to assimilate cholesterol. However, conflicting results of clinical trials remain concerning Lactobacillus species-effect on serum cholesterol levels.
Lactose intolerance
Acidophilus milk has been used to treat patients with lactose intolerance, although controversy remains regarding its effectiveness on lactose digestion."
5,Aconite,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesVarious species of Aconitum have been used for centuries both as poisons and medicines. The root is the most toxic plant part, although all parts are considered to be toxic. Extracts of Aconitum species have been given orally in traditional medicine to reduce fever associated with colds, pneumonia, laryngitis, croup, and asthma; for pain, inflammation, and high blood pressure; as a diuretic; to cause sweating; to slow heart rate; and for sedation. In traditional Asian medicine, root extracts are typically mixed with licorice or ginger. Extracts also have been used as arrow poisons. Historically, aconite was most commonly used in Western cultures as a tincture. It was applied topically as a counterirritant liniment for neuralgia, rheumatism, and sciatica. In homeopathy, aconite is used to treat fear, anxiety, and restlessness; acute sudden fever; symptoms from exposure to dry, cold weather or very hot weather; tingling, coldness, and numbness; influenza or colds with congestion; and heavy, pulsating headaches."

10,Alpha-Lipoic Acid,"
Alpha-lipoic acid is also called ALA. It is used by some people to help relieve nerve pain, diabetes, or other diseases. It may also help stop cell damage in the body. Other people have used it to help lower the pain in burning mouth syndrome. ALA is also used for macular degeneration, an eye problem that occurs with age or diabetes."
11,Angelica,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAngelica has been cultivated as a medicinal and flavoring plant in Scandinavian countries since the 12th century and in England since the 16th century. Angelica formerly was used as a sedative. The roots and seeds are used to distill a volatile oil used in perfumery and for a licorice flavoring in liqueurs and other alcoholic beverages. The candied leaves and stems are used to decorate cakes.General usesAngelica may have applications in treating epilepsy and anxiety; however, clinical trials are lacking to support therapeutic applications. Antioxidant activity has also been reported."
12,Anise,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAnise has a history of use as a spice and fragrance. It has been cultivated in Egypt for at least 4,000 years. Recordings of its diuretic use and treatment of digestive problems and toothache are seen in medical texts from this era. In ancient Greek history, writings explain how anise helps breathing, relieves pain, provokes urine, and eases thirst. The oil has been used commercially since the 1800s. The fragrance is used in food, soap, creams, and perfumes. Anise often is added to licorice candy or used as a ""licorice"" flavor substitute. It is a fragrant component of anisette liqueur. Anise is used widely as a flavoring in all food categories including alcohols, liqueurs, dairy products, gelatins, puddings, meats, and candies. It is sold as a spice, and the seeds are used as a breath freshener. The essential oil is used medicinally as well as in perfume, soaps, and sachets.Antispasmodic/ExpectorantAnise is well known as a carminative and an expectorant. Its ability to decrease bloating and settle the digestive tract still is used today, especially in pediatrics. In high doses, it is used as an antispasmodic and an antiseptic and for the treatment of cough, asthma, and bronchitis. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of anise as an expectorant or as an antimicrobial.Other usesThe oil of anise has been used for the treatment of lice, scabies, and psoriasis."
13,Aortic Extract,"

20,Barberry,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe plant has a long history of use, dating back to the Middle Ages. Tribes in the Pacific Northwest used M. aquifolium to treat acne, and other Native Americans used Mahonia berries to treat scurvy. The sundried fruits have been eaten for fever-reducer and urine-production effects in Turkey. A preparation of the plant has been used to treat GI ailments and coughs. The alkaloid berberine was included as an astringent in eye drops, but its use has become rare. The fruits have been used to prepare jams, jellies, and juices. The use of the plant in traditional medicine has been limited by the bitter taste of the bark and root. However, multiple medicinal uses for barberry, including cancer, cholera, and high blood pressure have been listed.General usesClinical applications may include use in treating diabetes and cholesterol disorders, although clinical trials are limited. Other activity includes antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. No clinical trials exist to support uses related to effects on the heart/blood vessel and central nervous systems or treating cancer."
21,Barley Grass,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBarley is considered to be the first cereal grain cultivated by humans. Its medicinal and food use dates back to 7000 BC. Crop reports on barley date back to 2440 BC, and the Chinese were cultivating barley circa 2000 BC. Since biblical times, ancient Asian and Middle Eastern cultures reportedly included young wheat and barley grass plants in their diets. Historically, the plant species was used in the treatment of skin, liver, blood, and GI disorders. Ancient Greeks used the mucilage derived from the cereal to treat GI inflammations. Gladiators ate barley for strength and stamina. The Roman physician Pliny used barley as part of a ritualized cure for boils.NutritionalIn 1940, it was explained how the vitamins, minerals, and protein in the cereal grasses are essential to animals and humans. A dehydrated preparation of cereal grass called ""cerophyl"" was approved as an ""accepted food"" by the Council of Foods of the American Medical Association in 1939. Later, synthetic nutrients were added to a number of foods, and multivitamins gained popularity. The juice of barley grass contains beta carotene, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, pantothenic acid, and folic acid. Minerals present include potassium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, and magnesium. Other constituents are chlorophyll, amino acids, protein, fiber, and enzymes. Cobalamin or vitamin B12 deficiency may be avoided in vegetarian diets by supplementation with dehydrated barley grass juice.Antioxidant activityBarley leaf extract has the ability to scavenge free radicals. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to play an important part in mediating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and can be instrumental in the pathogenesis of diseases such as rheumatoid synovitis, arthritis, and gout. Animal data shows an increased production of oxygen-free radicals with barley leaf extract added to the diet. Clinical studies show blood levels of oxygen-free radicals were reduced by supplementation with 15 g/day barley leaf extract in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Similar results were noted in nondiabetic, hyperlipidemic patients. More clinical studies are needed to show the extent of benefits in humans.Cancer preventionBarley grass extracts protect human tissue cells against carcinogens. The mechanism of action is unknown but may be associated with the plant's antioxidant activity or its chlorophyll content. It has been suggested that complexes may be formed between the carcinogen and the chlorophyll that may inactivate the carcinogen. In addition, antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase, found in high concentrations in green barley juice protect against radiation and free radicals. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of barley grass for cancer-preventive properties.HyperlipidemiaCholesterol-lowering effects have been attributed to the beta-sitosterol components, in part. Beta-sitosterol is thought to act by inhibiting the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and accelerating its catabolism to bile acid. Preliminary animal and clinical data show that total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were lowered. HCL cholesterol levels were increased. More clinical studies are needed to be conclusive.Other usesMany claims have been made regarding the health benefits of barley grass supplements. Suggested benefits include treatment of HIV infection, detoxification of pollutants, and boosting energy and immunity. However, objective evidence supporting many of these claims is lacking."
22,Bayberry,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe bayberry is best known for its berries, from which a wax is derived to make fragrant bayberry candles. In folk medicine, bayberry has been used as a tea for its tonic and stimulant properties, and for treating diarrhea. Among Native Americans, the leaves were used to destroy parasitic worms, the leaves and stems were used for treating fever, and the roots were applied as a poultice. It is also reported to have been used as a charm medicine to exorcise spirits of the dead and to prevent diseases. The dried root bark often is used medicinally and as a dyeing/tanning agent.General usesBayberry has been used traditionally for many conditions; however, clinical trials are lacking to validate these claims. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have been demonstrated in only 1 small clinical trial and animal data. Some protective effects on the liver were seen in 1 small study."
23,Bee Pollen,"
Bee pollen is used by some people for nutrients."
24,Beta Glucans,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBeta-glucans have been used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, and have been extensively studied for many years, particularly for their potential as immunomodulators. Traditional Chinese and Asian medicines extensively utilize medicinal mushrooms as a source of beta-glucan, while in the United States, early research focused on the immunomodulatory effects of zymosan derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.General usesReviews providing an overview of the beta-glucans are available, focusing largely on preventative roles in cancer and diseases related to the cardiovascular and immune systems. For more detailed information, see the individual monographs for the different beta-glucans sources (maitake [grifola], seaweed, and oats)."
25,Beta-Carotene,"
Beta-carotene helps to stop cell damage. It helps your body make vitamin A. People who are sensitive to the sun may take this product to protect them from sunlight. Some women eat more fruits and vegetables that contain beta-carotene to lower the risk of breast cancer. Other women may take it in small amounts to lower the risk of problems with pregnancy. It is also used for macular degeneration, an eye problem that can occur with age. Other people take this product to give a natural looking tan or skin color."
26,Beta-Sitosterol,"
Beta-sitosterol may be used by some people to help lower cholesterol. Men with a certain prostate problem may also use it."
27,Betaine Hydrochloride,"
Betaine hydrochloride (HCl) may help to raise the level of acid in the stomach. It may also help with some bowel problems. There is also a prescription drug, Betaine. It is not the same as this natural product. Take extra care so you do not mix them up as they are used for different illnesses."
28,Betel Nut,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe chewing of betel nut quids dates to antiquity. In the 1st century AD, Sanskrit medical writings claimed that betel nut possessed 13 qualities found in the region of heaven. It is pungent, bitter, spicy, sweet, salty, and astringent. It was said to expel wind, kill worms, remove phlegm, subdue bad odors, beautify the mouth, induce purification, and kindle passion. Because of its CNS stimulating effects, betel nut is used in a manner similar to the western use of tobacco or caffeine. Arecoline is responsible for some of the effects of betel quid chewing, such as alertness, increased stamina, a sense of well-being, euphoria, and salivation. Chewing the nut stimulates the flow of saliva to aid digestion. Betel nut also has been used to stimulate the appetite.Miscellaneous usesBetel nut's medical use is limited, and long-term negative reactions to betel quid chewing are well known. A decrease in positive symptoms among men with schizophrenia was attributed to betel nut consumption."
29,Betony,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesFew plants have as widespread a history as betony. Its use has been known since the Roman Empire, when it was considered a remedy for a wide variety of diseases. During the Middle Ages, the plant was ascribed magical powers. Today the plant continues to be used in traditional medicine. A weak infusion sometimes is taken as a tea. It is used as an astringent to treat diarrhea and as a gargle or tea for irritations of the mouth and throat. It has been used to treat anxiety and has been given as a tincture or smoked for the treatment of headache. The name ""betony"" may derive from the Celtic form of bew (a head) and ton (good).General usesExperimental or clinical studies to support the many traditional uses of betony are limited. Antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects have been demonstrated in animal or in vitro studies only."

35,Bladderwrack,"
Bladderwrack is used by some people as a food source. Others use it to help with weight loss or wound healing."
36,Bloodroot,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBloodroot was used by eastern American Indian tribes as a red dye and in the treatment of ulcers, skin conditions, and as a blood purifier as well as for treating ulcers and skin conditions. All of these medicinal uses derive from the appearance of the blood-red latex exuded from the fresh root. The juice also was used for coughs and sore throats, with the bitter taste masked by placing the juice on a lump of maple sugar that was then sucked. Higher oral doses were observed to expel phlegm and cause vomiting. The root entered 19th century medicine as a caustic topical treatment for skin cancers, polyps, and warts. Bloodroot has been marketed in toothpastes and mouthwashes for the prevention of gum disease and plaque, but studies have found it inferior to drugs such as doxycycline and chlorhexidine, with concerns about its toxicity."
37,Boldo,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn Chile, the yellowish-green fruit is eaten, its bark used in tanning, and its wood used for charcoal. Explorers noticed that local South Americans used the leaves medicinally and introduced the herb to North America and Great Britain to prevent or facilitate gas for stomach, bladder, and liver complaints, and as a mild sedative. The plant is used in natural medicine in the treatment of digestive disorders, as a laxative, choleretic (a stimulant of bile secretion), diuretic, and for hepatic diseases. The leaves also have been used for worms, gonorrhea, syphilis, gout, rheumatism, head colds, and earaches. Boldo extract is used as a flavoring for alcoholic beverages.General usesIn vitro and animal studies suggest boldo leaf extract and its part, boldine, possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects, as well as potential applications in diabetes, GI disorders, and cancer. However, clinical trials are lacking to support any therapeutic application."
38,Boneset,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBoneset has been used as a charm and as a medicinal remedy for centuries by indigenous North Americans. As a charm, the root fibers were applied to hunting whistles with the belief that they would increase the whistle's ability to call deer. As an herbal remedy, American Indians used boneset as an antipyretic (to reduce fevers). The early settlers used the plant to treat rheumatism, dropsy, dengue fever, malaria, pneumonia, and influenza. The name boneset was derived from the plant's use in the treatment of breakbone fever, a term describing the high fever that often accompanies influenza. Boneset was official in the US Pharmacopeia from 1820 to 1900.Miscellaneous usesBoneset chiefly has been used to treat fevers. Boneset sometimes is found in herbal combination products for colds, flu, and fevers. There are no clinical studies evaluating its safety or effectiveness in the treatment of these conditions."
39,Borage,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBorage leaves have been used as a potherb and in European herbal medicine since the Middle Ages. Borage leaves and flowers were added to wine and lemon juice to make the popular English beverages claret cup and cool tankard. The leaves have been used to treat rheumatism, colds, and bronchitis, as well as to increase lactation in women. Infusions of the leaves have been used to induce sweating and urination.General usesBorage has been used alone and in combination with fish oil for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, skin disorders, and bone weakening, although clinical evidence to support these uses is limited."
40,Boron,"
Boron is taken by some people who have low levels of boron. Others may take it to help with painful periods. Some women will use a form of this product called boric acid inside the vagina to treat a vaginal yeast infection."
41,Bovine Colostrum,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical UsesThe use of colostrum for both medicinal and spiritual purposes has been noted in the traditional Ayurvedic medical system and among the ancient Hindu rishis (spiritual leaders) of India. At the turn of the 20th century, the use of colostrum was advocated to protect infants against both human and bovine infections. Prior to the advent of sulfa drugs and other antibiotics, colostrum was used to boost defense against immune diseases. Albert Sabin isolated antipolio antibodies in bovine colostrum in the 1950s and the first experiments with hyperimmune colostrum were conducted in the 1960s.General UsesBovine colostrum may have a role in the management of HIV-associated diarrhea. Evidence is promising but weak for use in boosting the immune system, preventing infection, and in enhancing performance among athletes."
42,Brahmi,"
Brahmi is used by some people to help heal wounds."
43,Branched-Chain Amino Acids,"

45,Bromelain,"
Bromelain is taken by some people to help with swelling in the nose and sinuses. Others use it to help the immune system work well. Using bromelain on the skin may help remove dead skin from burns."
46,Buchu,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe Khoekhoe people (also spelled Khoikhoi) employed the leaves for the treatment of a great number of ailments. Early patent medicines sold in the United States hailed the virtues of the plant and its volatile oil for the management of diseases ranging from diabetes to nervousness. Buchu first was exported to Britain in 1790. In 1821, it was listed in the British Pharmacopoeia as a medicine for ""cystitis, urethritis, nephritis and catarrh of the bladder.""The drug had been included in the US National Formulary and was described as a diuretic and antiseptic. Its use since has been abandoned in favor of more effective diuretics and antibacterials. Buchu remains a popular ingredient in over-the-counter herbal diuretic preparations.Historically, buchu has been used to treat inflammation, and kidney and urinary tract infections; as a diuretic and as a stomach tonic. Other uses include carminative action and treatment of cystitis, urethritis, prostatitis, and gout. It also has been used for leukorrhea and yeast infections.Diuretic/Anti-inflammatoryBuchu remains a popular ingredient in over-the-counter herbal diuretic preparations. Despite the lack of evidence, buchu is still used today in western herbal medicine for urinary tract ailments, cystitis or urethritis prophylaxis, and prostatitis. It also is used in combination with other herbs such as cornsilk, juniper and uva-ursi. Buchu also is listed in the German Commission E Monographs to treat inflammation, kidney and urinary tract infections, and also is used as a diuretic, but the monograph explains that the plant's activity in these claimed uses has not been substantiated."
47,Bugleweed,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesTraditional uses of bugleweed include treatment of nosebleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding, and coughs. It has also been used as a sedative, astringent, and mild narcotic, and for tuberculosis characterized by bleeding from the lungs. More current uses are primarily for mild hyperthyroid conditions and for premenstrual syndrome, including breast pain (mastodynia).General usesBugleweed is used to treat mild hyperthyroidism, premenstrual syndrome, and breast pain; however, there are few clinical studies to support these uses."
48,Bupleurum,"
Bupleurum is an herb taken by some people as medicine. Science does not support the use of this product for any health problem."
49,Burdock,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn traditional medicine, the fruits, seeds, roots, and leaves of burdock have been used as extracts or teas for a wide range of ailments including colds, gout, rheumatism, stomach ailments, and cancers, and to promote urination, increase sweating, and facilitate bowel movements. It has also been promoted to increase sexual desire, and used for various skin problems. Burdock root is commonly used as food in Asia. Some US health stores carry fresh burdock root for sale as a food and nutraceutical.General usesAnti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects have been described for burdock whole root extract, as well as for its chemical components. Diabetes, cancer, CNS conditions, stomach ulcer, and inflammation of the colon are under investigation for possible burdock use; however, not enough clinical evidence is available."
50,Butcher's Broom,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesR. aculeatus was given its common name, butcher's broom, because its stiff twigs were bound together and used by butchers in Europe to keep their cutting boards clean. The plant has a long history of use. More than 2000 years ago, it was noted as a laxative, diuretic, and a phlebotherapeutic (beneficial to veins) agent. Extracts, decoctions, and poultices have been used throughout the ages, but the medicinal use of this plant did not become common until the last century. Early investigations during the 1950s indicated that extracts of butcher's broom could induce vasoconstriction and therefore might have use in the treatment of circulatory diseases. The increasing popularity of natural and herbal remedies in Europe in the 1970s reaffirmed its position in modern medicine. Novel uses for this plant have included its use as an anti-inflammatory agent and to prevent atherosclerosis.Venous conditionsA variety of compounds have been isolated from butcher's broom. The 2 primary active saponin compounds are ruscogenin and neoruscogenin. Butcher's broom is the active component in several produce formulations and topical treatments for venous diseases and venous insufficiency, such as varicose veins and hemorrhoids. Limited results showing some promise from clinical trials are available. The German Commission E approves oral use for supportive therapy for discomforts of chronic venous insufficiency and complaints of hemorrhoids. Butcher's broom also may be useful for orthostatic hypotension, although data is limited.Other usesNovel modern uses for this plant have included its use as an anti-inflammatory agent and to prevent atherosclerosis. The discovery of new pharmacological activity of butcher's broom, particularly as a cytotoxic agent, demonstrate the need for continued research on butcher's broom.Butcher's broom has been used in many forms as a laxative, diuretic, treatment for circulatory disease, and cytotoxic agent, although limited results from clinical trials are available."
51,Butterbur,"
Butterbur is used by some people to help treat seasonal allergies. Others may use it to prevent migraines."
52,Calanolide A,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesRain forests are a very promising source of natural medicines because of their vast diversity. It has been estimated that more than half of the world's 250,000 plant species exist in tropical rain forests. Searching for natural drugs in these areas, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) contracts scientists to gather specimens for analysis. In 1987, an Illinois team obtained samples from many trees, one of which was Calophyllum lanigerum. Four years later, the NCI discovered that a preparation from this gum tree was very effective against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).HIVInitial studies show promise for treating HIV-1. Calanolide A has been found to inhibit a wide variety of HIV-1 strains, drug-resistant strains, and HIV disease in various stages.Calanolide A appears to act early in the infection process, as calanolide A is an investigational drug. No clinical data is available yet.Calanolide A has been synthesized in the lab and was found to have similar actions to the natural product."
53,Calendula,"

60,Catnip,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesCatnip's leaves and shoots have been used as a flavoring in sauces, soups, and stews, and in several patented beverages, as well as in fruit table wines and liquors. The use of catnip leaves and flowers in herbal teas was documented at least as early as 1735 in the General Irish Herbal. Medicinally, the plant has been used to treat intestinal cramps, for indigestion, to cause sweating, to induce menstruation, as a sedative, and to increase appetite. Additionally, the plant has been used to treat diarrhea, colic, the common cold, and cancer. In Appalachia, nervous conditions, stomach ailments, hives, and the common cold have been treated with catnip tea. The dried leaves have been smoked to relieve respiratory ailments, and a poultice has been used externally to reduce swelling. In the early 1900s, the flowering tops and leaves were used to induce delayed menses. During the 1960s, catnip was reportedly smoked for its euphoric effects.General usesThere is little clinical data to support any use of catnip in humans, except as an insect repellant."
61,Centaury,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesGenus Erythraea is derived from the Greek erythros, relating to the red color of the flowers. The genus formerly was called Chironia, from Centaur, Chiron. Hippocrates describes centaurium, under the Greek Kentareion and according to legend, Chiron (founder of medicine) used centaury to heal a wound inflicted by a poisoned arrow. Historically, centaury has been used as an herbal medicine to kill worms, to treat dropsy, as a sedative, to treat snakebite and other wounds, and topically for freckles and spots. It is reputed to be an aromatic bitter and tonic for treating GI complaints such as bloating, dyspepsia, and flatulence, and anorexia. Centaury is said to act on the liver and kidneys to ""purify the blood,"" and for jaundice. Centaury also was used traditionally to treat fever, hence the name ""feverwort."" This bitter herb enhances production of gastric secretions, which stimulates appetite and improves digestion. Long-term use of the herb is required for the tonic effects on the stomach to fully develop. Other effects include anti-inflammatory as well as antimutagenic effects. Little research is available to support these traditional uses."

63,Chaparral,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesChaparral tea has been suggested for the treatment of bronchitis and the common cold. It also was used to alleviate rheumatic pain, stomach pain, chicken pox, and snake bite pain. American Indians used chaparral for arthritis, bowel cramps, gas, colds, and chronic skin disorders. Chaparral has been used internally to treat stomach problems, menstrual disorders, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, gall bladder and kidney stones, diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and upper respiratory tract infections. Skin application has been promoted for rheumatic and autoimmune conditions, arthritis, back pain, minor wounds, and skin infections, such as impetigo and gingivitis. Chaparral has also been used as a deodorant applied to the feet and armpits. A strong tea from the leaves has been mixed with oil as a burn salve. It is an ingredient in some nonprescription weight loss teas.In 1943, chaparral was approved by the Meat Inspection Division of the US War Food Administration as a food antioxidant. It was used as a fat and butter preservative until better preservatives were introduced; it was then removed from the FDA's GRAS (generally recognized as safe) list.In 1959, the National Cancer Institute received reports that several cancer patients claimed beneficial effects from drinking chaparral tea. Years later, a similar treatment was brought to the attention of physicians at the University of Utah.Reports subsequently appeared in the lay literature describing the virtues of chaparral tea as a cancer treatment.General usesChaparral has been primarily used for the treatment of cancer, acne, rheumatism, and diabetes. It has also been promoted for its antioxidant effects, and as a blood purifier and a weight loss agent. Clinical trials have not supported these uses."

65,Chickweed,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesChickweed has been used as a folk remedy for centuries for many conditions, including asthma, blood disorders, conjunctivitis, constipation, inflammation, dyspepsia, skin ailments, and obesity. Chickweed extract has been used internally as a demulcent, but is more typically used externally for the treatment of rashes and sores. The young shoots are edible and have been used as salad greens. In homeopathy, the plant is used to relieve rheumatic pains and psoriasis. Chickweed is noted as a folk remedy for many conditions, including asthma, blood disorders, conjunctivitis, constipation, inflammation, dyspepsia, skin ailments, and obesity.There is no indication that any of the plant's constituents possess therapeutic activity. Its vitamin content is too low to be of therapeutic value. A review of clinical research suggests that the plant is not actively under investigation, as there are no new pharmacological data to report."
66,Chicory,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn cultivation, chicory roots are ""forced"" during the fall and winter to produce 2 types of leaves used as greens: Barbe de capucin and witloof (or French endive). The leaves of young plants are used as potherbs, which are cooked like spinach. Leaves of older plants, when blanched, are used like celery. Chicory roots are boiled and eaten with butter, and roasted roots are ground and brewed to add a bitter, mellow taste to coffee and tea or used as a substitute for coffee. In Indian texts, whole plant chicory is used as a heart, digestive, stomach, and liver tonic, as well as a diuretic and anti-inflammatory agent. Use of chicory for stomach problems and as an appetite stimulant is recognized by the German Commission E.General usesChicory leaves and roots are used as a vegetable. Roasted roots are ground and brewed as a hot beverage. Use of chicory for stomach problems and as an appetite stimulant is recognized by the German E Commission; however, clinical studies are lacking to support this or any other use. Chicory-derived inulin (a naturally occurring polysaccharide) has been investigated for its potential as a prebiotic and laxative; efficacy of chicory extract has been studied in osteoarthritis."

76,Comfrey,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesComfrey has been cultivated as a green vegetable and has been used as an herbal medicine for more than 2,000 years. Comfrey's original name, knitbone, derives from the external use of poultices of its leaves and roots to heal burns, sprains, swelling, and bruises. In Western Europe, comfrey has been used topically for treating inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, gout, and thrombophlebitis, and internally for treating diarrhea. Comfrey has been claimed to heal gastric ulcers and hemorrhoids, and to suppress bronchial congestion and inflammation. Commercial comfrey sale and distribution is restricted in Germany and Canada because of its substantial toxicity.General usesTherapeutic use of comfrey is limited because of its toxicity.

78,Crampbark,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe American variety was used by the Iroquois for prolapsed uterus after childbirth, and other tribes recognized its use as a diuretic. The Eclectic medical movement in the 19th century adopted cramp bark for dysmenorrhea and to prevent miscarriage. It was believed to be a stronger antispasmodic than the related Viburnum species V. prunifolium (black haw). The bark was made official in the U.S. Pharmacopeia in 1894 and was included in the National Formulary in 1916. Widespread adulteration by mountain maple (Acer spicatum) and other Viburnum species led to confusion about the correct source plant. A later review surveyed the botanical, chemical, and pharmacological differences between black haw and cramp bark.Uterine relaxantCramp bark has been used for painful menstruation and to prevent miscarriage. Animal studies show that cramp bark relaxes uterine tissues. However, no clinical studies examining efficacy in humans have been performed."

The oil, which is derived by steam distillation, is used to flavor alcoholic beverages, desserts, and condiments. It is also used as a fragrant component of creams, lotions, and perfumes.General usesCumin seeds are used in cooking and the oil is used to flavor food and scent cosmetics. Components may have antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial, and larvicidal effects. Cumin may lower blood sugar, reduce seizures, strengthen bones, and treat the eye; however, there is no clinical evidence to support these claims. Cumin is generally recognized as safe for human consumption as a spice and flavoring."
82,Damiana,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe scientific literature on the plant dates back more than 100 years when reports described its aphrodisiac effects. Damiana history began with its early use by the Maya (under the name mizibcoc) in the treatment of giddiness and loss of balance. Its primary use in the last century has been as an aphrodisiac. Father Juan Maria de Salvatierra, a Spanish missionary, first reported that the Mexican Indians made a drink from the damiana leaves, added sugar and drank it for its love-enhancing properties. In the 1870s, it was imported into the US as a tincture and advertised as a powerful aphrodisiac, to improve the sexual ability of the enfeebled and the aged and to provide increased activity to all the pelvic secretions. Suffice to say that in this patent medicine era, it enjoyed some success.Damiana was admitted into the first edition of the National Formulary (NF) in 1888 as an elixir and fluid extract. However, it never made it into the US Pharmacopeia and the elixir finally was dropped from the NF in 1916. The fluid extract and the crude drug (leaves) were listed in the NF until 1947. Although some commercial companies continued to sell it to the American market, damiana had almost disappeared until the 1960s ""hippy"" movement brought it back into popularity.Aphrodesiac/HallucinogenToday, damiana has found its way into a number of herbal OTC products, in particular those claiming to induce a legal herbal ""high.""In the Caribbean, damiana leaves are boiled in water and the vapors inhaled for the relief of headaches. Teas are said to aid in the control of bed wetting. No substantive data is available to support the aphrodisiac effects of damiana. Although it has been postulated that the plant may contain the central nervous system stimulant caffeine, the aphrodisiac effect has not been attributed to any specific components. The volatile oil in damiana might be sufficiently irritating to the urethral mucous membranes to account for its so-called aphrodisiac effects.Despite containing a complex mixture of components, there is no evidence to support claims for a hallucinogenic effect."

Limited studies have shown efficacy in coronary artery disease and stroke, but the quality of study methods limits the validity of the findings."
85,Deer Velvet,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe word antler is derived from the Latin Anteoculae, meaning ""in front of the eyes."" Antlers are present in almost all members of the deer family Cervidae. The first documented evidence of deer velvet as a medicinal was found on a scroll recovered from a tomb in Hunan China dating back 2000 years. The use of antler dates back to the Han Dynasty 206 BC to 220 AD. A 16th century medical text, Pen Ts'ao Kang Mu, lists several antler preparations including pills, tinctures, and ointments. In traditional Chinese medicine, velvet antler has been used for over 2000 years as a tonic, to improve bone health, to nourish the blood, reduce swelling, and to treat impotence. Later research on deer antler dates back to the 1980s in Russia. Hundreds of articles since have been published including those documented by Chinese, Korean, and Japanese scientists.In Chinese medicine, deer velvet has been used to treat impotence, female disorders, urinary problems, skin ailments, and knee weakness. It also is employed as a tonic in children with learning disabilities or insufficient growth. Koreans use antler velvet to treat anemia and impotence and to stimulate the immune system, treat impotence, improve heart function, muscle tone, lung efficiency, and nerve function.Miscellaneous usesDeer antler contains chondroitin sulfate, a compound that may help treat arthritis. Prostaglandins, also present in velvet antler, are known for their anti-inflammatory effects.

90,Dragon's Blood,"


Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesSangre de grado, Spanish for ""blood of the dragon,"" has a long history of use for both the bark and the resin. An early reference dating back to the 1600s notes that Spanish explorer P. Bernabe Cobo found the sap was being used by indigenous tribes throughout Peru and Ecuador. C. lechleri resin and bark are used in traditional medicine in South America. They used it internally and externally to stop bleeding, help heal wounds, and treat intestinal problems. Studies regarding this plant date back to the late 1970s. Preparations made from dragon's blood are found in several pharmaceutical products, some of them patentedWound-healer/AntiviralDragon's blood has been used for its antiviral and wound-healing effects. Taspine, a component of dragon's blood, has been documented to have anti-inflammatory and wound-healing actions. Taspine and a proanthocyanidin component also have been shown to have antiviral activities. Animal and laboratory tests have shown some promise for the use of dragon's blood for these medicinal effects. To date, there are no human clinical studies verifying these effects.GI effectsDragon's blood also plays a role in GI health. Practitioners are reporting it beneficial for stomach ulcers, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease when taken internally. Preparations made from dragon's blood are found in several pharmaceutical products, some of them patented. A patent describing use of the proanthocyanidin polymer from croton species (SP-303) as an antidiarrheal was issued to Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. USA. A clinical trial of the principal ingredient (SP-303) in patients with HIV-associated diarrhea demonstrated beneficial effects.

94,Emu Oil,"


Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe Aboriginal people of Australia have used emu oil for centuries. The oil was collected by either hanging the emu skin from a tree or wrapping it around an affected area and allowing the heat of the sun to liquefy the emu fat to enhance absorption into the skin.Emu oil was used medicinally to treat muscle and joint problems and a variety of skin conditions. Other purported medicinal uses include the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. The oil also has been used for cooking as well as for keeping leather riding tackle supple.Anti-inflammatory/Wound healingNearly all clinical and scientific studies focus on the anti-inflammatory properties of emu oil. In animal studies, the topical application of emu oil had anti-inflammatory effects comparable to oral ibuprofen. In humans, emu oil was evaluated as a lubricant and aided in reducing scar formation in healed burns. Wounds treated with emu oil also healed significantly better. However, more research is needed to fully explain the benefits of emu oil."

99,Fennel,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAccording to Greek legend, man received knowledge from Mount Olympus in the form of a fiery coal held in a stalk of fennel. The herb was known to the ancient Chinese, Indian, Egyptian, and Greek civilizations; the Roman scholar Pliny recommended it for improving eyesight. The name foeniculum is from the Latin word for ""fragrant hay."" Fennel was in great demand during the Middle Ages. Wealthy people added the seed to fish and vegetable dishes, while the poor reserved it as an appetite suppressant to be eaten on fasting days. The plant was introduced to North America by Spanish priests and the English brought it to their early settlements in Virginia. All parts of the plant have been used for flavorings, and the stalks have been eaten as a vegetable. The seeds aid digestion. Fennel has been used to flavor candies, liqueurs, medicines, and food, and it is especially favored for pastries, sweet pickles, and fish. The oil can be used to protect stored fruits and vegetables against growth of toxic fungi. Beekeepers have grown it as a honey plant. Health claims have included its use as a purported antidote to poisonous herbs, mushrooms, and snakebites. It also has been used for the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammation, indigestion, to stimulate milk flow in breast-feeding, as an expectorant, and to induce menstruation.

In traditional medicine, the plant has been used to treat eczema and other dermatologic conditions. It has been used as a laxative and diuretic. Fumaria species are used in Turkish folk medicine as a blood purifier and an anti-allergic agent.Miscellaneous usesFumitory has a long history of use in traditional medicine and has been investigated for its therapeutic potential in the management of cardiovascular and hepatobiliary disorders and psoriasis. Limited evidence suggests that fumitory may have cardiovascular benefits, but there is no clinical data to substantiate this claim. Fumaria extracts also may be useful in the management of disorders of the hepatobiliary tract. F. officinalis is approved in Germany for the colicky pain affecting the gallbladder and biliary system, together with the GI tract. F. officinalis is approved in Germany for the colicky pain affecting the gallbladder and biliary system, in addition to the GI tract. Furmaric acid esters have been used as a treatment for psoriasis for nearly 30 years, and there is renewed interest in this area by dermatologists. Research also reveals no clinical data regarding the use of fumitory for diabetes, although there is 1 animal study indicating its potential use in lowering glucose levels."
109,Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA),"Overview
Fatty acids are the basic building blocks for all lipids. They consist of chains of carbon and hydrogen with an end acid group. Fatty acids vary in length and degree of saturation and generally are up to 26 carbons long. The polyunsaturated fatty acids contain more than 1 double bond. The double bonds are at carbon 3 (n-3) or 6 (n-6). GLA falls into the latter family, known as omega-6 fatty acids.
The actual location of the double bond significantly affects metabolism of the fatty acid, such that the structure and function of omega-3 derived eicosanoids differ from those derived from the omega-6 fatty acids (eg, arachidonic acid). For example, omega-3 derived eicosanoids tend to decrease blood clotting and inflammatory responses. This contrasts significantly with the arachidonic acid (omega-6) derived eicosanoids, which increase clotting and inflammatory responses.
Unsaturated fatty acids are essential components of cell membranes and can influence receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and signal transduction pathways. They can influence numerous inflammatory and immunological processes.
Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
The evening primrose plant is native to North America and was introduced into Europe in the 17th century. Native Americans consumed the leaves, roots, and seedpods as food and prepared extracts of the oil for use as a painkiller and asthma treatment. Some of these early therapeutic effects are thought to be because of GLA, which is found in high quantities in the oil.
In the 1930s and 1940s, several investigators found dietary supplementation with essential fatty acids such as GLA to be of therapeutic value in atopic dermatitis (AD). The advent of topical glucocorticoids brought an end to this form of treatment. However, by the early 1980s, there was a return to using these agents because of the unwanted side effects of glucocorticoids, and they have regained scientific interest. Over the last 2 decades, numerous other indications have been proposed for GLA.
Rheumatoid arthritis
Clinical studies using GLA (evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, blackcurrant seed oil) suggest a potential relief of pain, morning stiffness, and joint tenderness in rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. Benefits appeared to be increased when dosages were greater than 1.4 g/day of GLA, and administered for at least 6 months.
Cardiovascular protection
The apparent low death rate from coronary heart disease among Eskimos has focused interest on the potential benefits of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A small clinical study showed benefits in lowering total cholesterol and LDL, and raising HDL cholesterol. These effects suggest that GLA may contribute to cardiovascular protection. However, this is still an area of controversy.
Diabetes mellitus
GLA has been studied as for its possible benefits for diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic patients have abnormalities of essential fatty acid metabolism, and therefore require higher amounts of essential fatty acids. Studies have shown that the development of cataracts, retinopathy, and cardiovascular damage can all be slowed by the administration of large daily doses of essential fatty acid. Clinical studies have demonstrated consistent and progressive improvement of neuropathies when treated with GLA.
Atopic diseases/Asthma/Psoriasis
GLA has been shown in clinical studies to reduce itching, redness, and toughness of atopic skin. GLA also reduces the inflammation and overall severity of atopic dermatitis, while atopic disease in children often presents as bronchial asthma later in life. However, there have been no animal or clinical studies regarding the use of GLA for atopic bronchial asthma. Although psoriasis does not have an atopic component, the use of GLA has been investigated clinically with inconsistent results.
Other uses
GLA supplementation has been shown to increase lymphocytes, a key component in immune response. It also has been proposed that GLA may play important roles in cancer treatment. Small clinical studies have shown some improvement in immunologic status with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer and bladder cancer. Clinical studies have shown that GLA is effective in relieving PMS symptoms, including breast pain."
110,Gamma Oryzanol,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesRice bran oil is used extensively, especially in Asia, for cooking. It has a nut-like flavor and a high smoke point, making it suitable for deep frying and cooking at high temperatures. Rice bran extracts are used in the cosmetic industry.Isolation, extraction, and purification of gamma oryzanol were first reported in the mid-1950s. It has been sold in Japan as a medicine since 1962, first to treat anxiety and later in menopause. Gamma oryzanol and rice bran oil therapy have been used to manage elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels since the late 1980s.General usesClinical trial data are often of poor methodology, making it difficult to support suggested clinical applications; however, rice bran oil and its components may have applications in high cholesterol, cancer, and dermatology."

113,Gelsemium,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesGelsemium has been used as an ingredient in some analgesic and homeopathic products, but its use has been limited due to its toxicity. At the turn of the century, it was a popular ingredient in asthma and respiratory remedies. Related species have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat neuralgia and various painful conditions.Miscellaneous usesGelsemium and its principle alkaloid gelsemine have been reported to exert central stimulant and analgesic effects, being able to potentiate the effects of aspirin and phenacetin. The plant has been investigated for its anticancer properties. To date, research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of gelsemium for stimulant or analgesic effects."
114,Gentian,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe gentians have been used for centuries as bitters to stimulate the appetite, improve digestion, and to treat a variety of GI complaints (eg, heartburn, vomiting, stomach ache, diarrhea). Stemless gentian usually is consumed as a tea or alcoholic extract, such as Angostura bitters. The extracts are used in a variety of foods, cosmetics, and some antismoking products. The plant has been used externally to treat wounds, and internally to treat sore throat, arthritic inflammation, and jaundice. Despite the name, the dye gentian violet is not derived from this plant.General usesNo clinical trials support traditional use of gentian to stimulate appetite, improve digestion, or treat GI complaints. Gentian has also been used to induce menstruation and to treat wounds, sore throat, arthritic inflammation, and jaundice."

127,Guarana,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesGuarana has played an important role in the Amazonian Indians' society. It often is taken during periods of fasting to improve tolerance of dietary restrictions. In certain regions, the extract is believed to be an aphrodisiac and to protect from malaria and dysentery. In 1840, caffeine was identified as guarana's principal constituent. In the 19th century, guarana became popular as a stimulating drink in France. In 1880 it was introduced as an official drug in the US Pharmacopeia, where it remained listed until 1910. Guarana is used by Brazilian Indians in a stimulating beverage used like tea or coffee. It sometimes is mixed with alcohol to prepare a more intoxicating beverage. The stems, leaves, and roots of guarana are used as a fish-killing drug in Central and South America.StimulantGuarana contains caffeine, a stimulant. By comparison, coffee beans contain about 1-2% caffeine and the dried leaves of guarana contain from 1-4% caffeine.Natural diet aids, which rely on daily doses of guarana, have been advertised in the lay press. Guarana occasionally is combined with glucomannan in natural weight loss tablets. The advertisements indicate that the ingredients in guarana have the same chemical makeup as caffeine and cocaine, but can be used for weight reduction without any of the side effects of these drugs. This is not entirely correct. Guarana does not contain cocaine, and may have serious side effects for some people.The appetite suppressant effect is related to the caffeine content. The energy that guarana tablets are reported to give also is due to caffeine. This stimulating effect is so widely recognized that 1 guarana product was marketed as ""Zoom."" Numerous investigational studies have shown the ability of the sympathetic stimulant ephedrine, when coupled with caffeine, to have a synergistic effect on increasing metabolic rates with subsequent increased energy expenditure (thermogenesis), and to have fat reducing (lipolytic) effects. These effects have resulted in a statistically significant weight loss in animal and human trials when combined with diet.Guarana has been used as a natural energizer, cognitive stimulant, flavoring for beverages, and as a component in natural weight loss products. However, it cannot be recommended as a natural energizer or weight loss aid because of its potential serious side effects."
128,Guggul,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe plant has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries in the treatment of a variety of disorders, most notably arthritis, and as a weight-reducing agent in obesity. Other traditional uses have included treatment of liver problems, tumors, ulcers and sores, urinary complaints, intestinal worms, swelling, and seizures, and as a heart tonic. In 1986, guggal was approved for marketing in India as a cholesterol-lowering agent. A commercial product, Guggulow, claiming cholesterol-lowering properties, is widely available on the Internet.General usesGuggul has been used in the traditional Ayurvedic medical system for centuries and has been studied extensively in India. Commercial products are promoted for lowering cholesterol; however, clinical studies do not support this claim. Anti-inflammatory and heart/blood vessel effects are being evaluated, as well as use in cancer, obesity, and diabetes."
129,Gymnema,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesGymnema has played an important role in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. Its use has been confined primarily to the management of diabetes and similar conditions of altered blood sugar. As early as 1930, these effects of the plant were investigated. The leaves also have been used for stomach ailments, constipation, water retention, and liver disease. The flowers, leaves, and fruits have been used in the treatment of alterations of blood pressure and heart rhythms. Chewing the leaves destroys the ability to identify the sweet taste, giving it the common Hindi name of gurmar, or ""sugar destroyer."" The plant has become available in a number of commercial over-the-counter herbal products.General usesThe plant has been used in traditional medicine, most notably to control blood sugar. Use of gymnema as a lipid-lowering agent, for weight loss, and to prevent cavities has also been investigated, primarily in rat or mouse studies. However, little to no clinical information is available to support the use of gymnema for any indication."
130,Hawthorn,"
Hawthorn is used by some people to help with heart failure or other coronary diseases. It may help lower cholesterol or high blood pressure. Some people use it to lower anxiety and pain."
131,Hibiscus,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
The hibiscus has had a lengthy history of use in Africa and neighboring tropical countries. Its fragrant flowers have been used in sachets and perfumes. In areas of northern Nigeria, this plant has been used to treat constipation. Fiber from H. sabdariffa has been used to fashion rope as a jute substitute. The fleshy red calyx is used in the preparation of jams, jellies, and cold and warm teas and drinks. The leaves have been used like spinach. The plant is used widely in Egypt for the treatment of cardiac and nerve diseases and has been described as a diuretic. In Iran, drinking sour tea for the treatment of hypertension is a popular practice. It has been used in the treatment of cancers. Research reveals little or no evidence of these medicinal uses of hibiscus. The mucilaginous leaves are used as a topical emollient in Africa. In Western countries, hibiscus flowers often are found as components of herbal tea mixtures. In Thailand, people consume roselle juice to quench thirst. Karkade seed products (ie, karkade defatted flour, protein concentrate, protein isolate) have been studied for their nutritional and functional value.
Hypertension
A randomized clinical trial evaluated the effect of sour tea available commercially in Iran on essential hypertension in otherwise healthy volunteers. A decrease in blood pressure was seen. However, after cessation of drinking the sour tea, a rise in blood pressure occurred. Although no adverse effects were seen in this study, the use of sour tea for treating hypertension requires further study.
Antibacterial/Vermifuge
Aqueous extracts of hibiscus appear to exert a slight antibacterial effect. In laboratory and animal studies, worms were killed by hibiscus extracts. Research reveals little or no clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as an antibacterial or vermifuge (kill worms).
Chemopreventive effects
Components of hibiscus have shown potential as a chemopreventative agent against tumor promotion in laboratory and animal studies. These components also possess anti-inflammatory properties. Research reveals little or no clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as a chemopreventive agent.
Laxative effects
The plant has been used as a mild laxative. While animal studies show a mild cathartic effect, research reveals little or no human clinical data regarding the use of hibiscus as a laxative.
Other uses
Hibiscus has been studied for its use in preventing renal stone formation, as well as its respiratory and sedative effects. To date there is no clinical evidence to prove any of these beneficial medical effects. Additionally, hibiscus anthocyanins have shown antioxidant activity in protecting against hepatotoxicity in rats. Application and action in humans has yet to be investigated."
132,Holly,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPlants in the holly family have been used as ornamentals and in herbal medicine for centuries. Early history records the European pagans offering holly branches as gifts during the Saturnalia. Early Christians decorated their homes with holly during Christmas, a practice that continues today. The early settlers in the southeastern United States made yaupon tea from I. vomitoria, reserving a stronger decoction for use as an emetic. I. opaca fruit tea had been used as a cardiac stimulant by the American Indians; the Chinese used it to treat coronary disease.One of the most economically important species, Ilex paraguayensis or Maté tea (see separate monograph), has long been cultivated and used in Brazil and Paraguay as a tea-like beverage containing caffeine. The mixed leaves of Ilex cassine, I. vomitoria, and Ilex dahoon also were used for a hot drink called yaupon or black drink. Drinkers used it ceremonially to ""cleanse"" themselves, probably due to its sweat- and vomit-inducing effects. Another beverage made from the leaves of I. cassine and I. vomitoria was used as a stimulant tea in the southern United States during the Civil War.Other usesHolly is primarily used as a holiday decoration. Historically, it has been used in teas as an emetic and a CNS stimulant. There is little clinical research regarding the medicinal uses of holly."
133,Hops,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesHops have been used for centuries to flavor and preserve beer. The bitter, aromatic taste of beer mostly is due to the hops content. Hops extracts also are used for other flavoring purposes in the food industry. Hops pickers have reported sedation during harvest, and hops flowers have been added to pillows for relief of nervous conditions.SedativeHops often is included in combination with valerian in sleep aids. Observation that hops pickers experienced sedation has prompted investigation. There are no clinical studies to validate this use.PhytoestrogenicEstrogenic effects also were observed in evaluation of hops extract for the treatment of menstrual symptoms. There are no clinical studies to validate this use.Other usesHops bitter acids have substantial effects on metabolic enzymes. A comprehensive evaluation of components of hops as a cancer chemoprentative found that it warranted clinical investigation because it had distinct activities at the initiation, promotion, and progression stages of carcinogenesis. There are no clinical studies to validate this use.Hops bitter acids have antibacterial and antifungal activity important for the preservative function of hops in beer."
134,Horehound,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe leaves and flower tops of the horehound have long been used in home remedies as a bitter tonic for the common cold. Horehound has been used traditionally as an expectorant and continues to find a place in cough lozenges and cold preparations. It now is used primarily as flavorings in liqueurs, candies and cough drops. In addition, extracts of the plant were used for the treatment of intestinal parasites and as a diaphoretic and diuretic. A different genus, the black horehound (Ballota nigra), is a fetid-odored perennial native to the Mediterranean area that sometimes is used as an adulterant of white horehound.Miscellaneous usesHorehound has been used as a vasodilator, diaphoretic, diuretic, and treatment for intestinal parasites. Initial animal studies indicate that horehound may have hypoglycemic effects and may influence bile secretion. The volatile oil of horehound has been reported to have expectorant and vasodilatory effects. Evidence is limited on these medicinal uses."
135,Horny Goat Weed,"
Horny goat weed is used by some people to lower blood pressure. Others believe it will help with erectile dysfunction and low sex drive. It is used by some people to help with bone loss."
136,Horse Chestnut,"
Horse chestnut is used by some people to help with leg pain and swelling caused by problems with the veins in the legs. Others use it to help with hemorrhoids. Some people believe it helps with bruising."
137,Horseradish,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesHorseradish has been cultivated and used as a medicine and condiment for approximately 2,000 years. Early settlers brought the horseradish plant to America and the plant was commonplace in gardens by the early 1800s. Hardy varieties were obtained through plant selection and grown easily in the Midwest.The horseradish root is used as a condiment and may be grated and mixed with other flavorings to make sauce or relish. Young, tender leaves have been used as a potherb and as a salad green. Horseradish is 1 of the 5 bitter herbs (horseradish, coriander, horehound, lettuce, nettle) consumed during the Jewish holiday of Passover. The root has a long history of use in traditional medicine. It has been used to treat lung and urinary tract infections, inflammation of the joints and tissues, sinus congestion, and swelling. It was applied to the skin to reduce pain from sciatica and facial pain. Internally, it was used to expel afterbirth, relieve colic, increase urination, and to kill intestinal worms in children.General usesHorseradish has been used internally as a condiment, GI stimulant and diuretic, and to treat intestinal worms, and externally for sciatica and facial pain. However, there are no clinical trials to support any therapeutic use for horseradish. Animal data suggest potential antibacterial and blood pressure-lowering effects."
138,Horsetail,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesTraditionally, the plant has been used as a diuretic, an antitubercular drug, and in the treatment of genitourinary and respiratory disorders, arthritis, and bleeding ulcers. Owing to the abrasive nature of its high silica content, horsetail has been used to clean dishes, sand wood, and polish metal. Externally, it has been used in cosmetics and as an astringent to stop bleeding and stimulate wound healing.Miscellaneous usesHorsetail may exert slight diuretic activity, although studies are needed to prove this. The historical data reporting the use of horsetail in the treatment of urological disorders, tuberculosis, or to enhance wound healing lacks clinical evidence."
139,Huperzine A,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe use of club moss can be traced back to the Chinese pharmacopoeias of the Tang dynasty as Shi Song, used for the treatment of rheumatism and colds, to relax muscles and tendons, and to improve blood circulation. The club moss H. serrata has been used in Chinese folk medicine under the name Qian Ceng Ta (Chien Tseng Ta) for the treatment of bruises, strains, swelling, and, more recently, organophosphate poisoning, myasthenia gravis, and schizophrenia. The study of the chemistry and pharmacology of the plant and its alkaloids gained momentum in the 1980s from Chinese scientists.Alzheimer diseaseA Cochrane review of the effect of huperzine A in Alzheimer disease, as well as other reviews, note the lack of quality long-term clinical trials to support definitive statements about a place in therapy for huperzine A, despite numerous clinical studies being undertaken.Other usesHistorically, club moss has been used for the treatment of bruises, strains, swelling, rheumatism, and colds, to relax muscles and tendons, and to improve blood circulation. Because of its anticholinesterase activity, huperzine A, a constituent of the whole plant, has been studied for potential use in treating Alzheimer disease and other CNS disorders; however, there is still insufficient evidence to support its routine use."
140,Hyaluronic Acid,"
Some people use hyaluronic acid to help with dry eye. Others use it to help with arthritis. It may also be used to help heal wounds, burns, or mouth sores."
141,Hyssop,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesHyssop has been noted for centuries in herbal medicine. In addition, there are a number of references in the Bible to plants called ""hyssop,"" although there is considerable controversy regarding the actual identity of these plants. There is little evidence that the plant mentioned in Bible was actually ""H. officinalis.""The ancient use of this plant was an insecticide, insect repellent, and pediculicide (lice eradicator). Extracts of plant have been used as a fragrance in soaps and perfumes, and to flavor liqueurs, sauces, puddings, and candies.Miscellaneous usesThe plant has been used in herbal medicine for the treatment of sore throats, colds, hoarseness, and as an expectorant. Some herbalists also believe that hyssop has beneficial effects for asthma, urinary tract inflammation, and appetite stimulation. Its effectiveness in relieving gas and colic also are listed under its medicinal uses. None of these uses have been studied clinically.Although an extract of the leaves has been suggested for the treatment of wounds, there does not appear to be strong evidence for its effectiveness as an antibacterial.Still used today by herbalists for its beneficial effects, hyssop's volatile oil represents the most important fraction of this plant. It may have some small beneficial effect in the treatment of sore throats and as an expectorant. However, clinical studies are lacking for any medicinal use of hyssop."
142,Inositol Hexaphosphate,"
Inositol is used by some people to help with mental conditions like low mood, panic attacks, or obsessive compulsive disorder. Others use it to help with diabetes."
143,Ipecac,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBrazilian Indians valued ipecac as a remedy for dysentery, and this information was brought to Europe by Portuguese missionaries. The dried root and rhizome are the source of the medicinally useful products. Ipecac has been widely used in syrup form as a potent and effective emetic. Ipecac powder had been used to induce sweating at the onset of influenza, and small amounts of the extract have been incorporated into cough syrups as expectorants. Emetine, derived from the root, has been used for more than a century to treat dysentery.EmeticIpecac induces vomiting by an irritant action on the intestinal mucosa and produces reflex vomiting and diarrhea. It also exerts a central emetic action. Emetine, one of its principle active components, primarily has a central action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone. The syrup induces vomiting in 15 to 60 minutes and is most effective when accompanied by fluid intake.Debate surrounds the use of ipecac. One study found no apparent benefit when syrup of ipecac was used in the home, although there may be a benefit in certain poisonings. This remains to be proven.Ipecac should be administered to an alert, conscious person who has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison. Do not administer ipecac to someone who has ingested either a corrosive substance or hydrocarbon with a high aspiration potential (eg, gasoline).Maximum benefit can be expected in those patients who take ipecac soon after poison ingestion.AmebicideEmetine, a component of ipecac, also has amebicidal components. While ipecac is not effective against amebic dysentery, it may be useful for amebic abscesses and hepatitis. Emetine injected intramuscularly is distributed systemically."
144,Jojoba,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAmerican Indians and Mexicans have long used jojoba oil as a hair conditioner and restorer, and in medicine, cooking, and rituals. In the United States, jojoba is considered a viable cash crop for the southwestern Indians, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs has funded most of the studies in this area.With the banning of the sale of sperm whale oil in the 1970s, the cosmetic industry turned to jojoba oil for use in shampoos, moisturizers, sunscreens, and conditioners. It has further potential as an industrial lubricant because it does not break down under high temperature or pressure. A disadvantage to its use is its relatively high cost.General usesThe toxicity of the constituent simmondsin in jojoba seed meal and some oil components limits the likelihood of clinical use. Jojoba oil is commonly used in dermatological preparations."
145,Juniper,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesJuniper berries (the mature female cone) have been used as a flavoring in foods and alcoholic beverages such as gin. In herbal medicine, juniper has been used for indigestion and as a steam inhalant in the management of bronchitis. The native people of North America have used juniper as medicine that refreshes/restores and in tuberculosis, among other conditions. The berries also serve as seasonings for pickling meats and as flavoring for liqueurs and bitters. Other uses include perfumery and cosmetics. Juniper tar also is used for its gin-like flavor and in perfumery.General usesJuniper berries have been used as a flavoring for beverages and as a seasoning for cooking, as well as in traditional medicine. Limited clinical evidence exists for effectiveness or harm, and use should be limited to low concentrations."
146,Kalonji,"
Kalonji may be used by some people as medicine. Science currently does not support the use of this product for any health problem."
147,Kaolin Hydrated Aluminum Silicate,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesKaolin has been used commercially and medicinally for hundreds of years. It is currently found in the manufacture of pottery, bricks, cement, plastering material, color lakes (insoluble dyes), and insulators. As a raw material, it is commonly found in paper, plastics, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, and it is also used in pharmaceutical preparations as a filtering agent to clarify liquids.General usesKaolin has traditionally been used internally to control diarrhea. Kaolin has also been used topically as an emollient and drying agent. Specifically, it has been used to dry oozing and weeping poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac rashes. It has also been used as a protectant for the temporary relief of anorectal itching and diaper rash."
148,Kava,"
Kava is used by some people to help lower anxiety and as a sleep aid. Others use it to relax muscles. Some people may use this to help prevent cancer."
149,Kombucha,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe name ""kombucha"" is derived from Japanese; it is brewed in a seaweed (kombu) tea (cha). In Western countries, the product typically is grown in black tea; spores are floated on the surface of brewed, sweetened black tea. The vegetative part of the fungus doubles in mass approximately every week. The mass then is divided and the new portion is grown on a new tea mixture. As the growth matures, it ferments the beverage slightly and it is consumed for its possible medicinal properties. Drinking fermented teas has long been popular in Eastern countries, and the use of this particular growth may date back several centuries.Kombucha tea has grown rapidly in popularity in the past year, and has been promoted as a miracle cure for a wide variety of illnesses ranging from memory loss to premenstrual syndrome. Despite claims for its drug activity, some experts believe that the tea meets the US Food and Drug Administration requirements as a fraudulent product: reference to non-US medical studies, an appeal to vanity, ancient origins, and alleged cures for a wide variety of ailments. Some of these claims include curing cancer, rheumatism, and intestinal disorders, as well as reversing the effects of aging.General usesEvidence does not support the drug claims for kombucha teas; rare case reports of severe toxicity exist."
150,Kudzu,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesKudzu was introduced to the United States in the late 1800s to control soil erosion, and although widely recognized as a ground cover and fodder crop in the Western world, the plant has a long history of medicinal use in Asian cultures. Beginning in the 6th century BC, Chinese herbalists used the plant for prevention of intoxication, muscular pain, and treatment of measles. Kudzu is native to Japan, China, and Fiji.General usesCurrent interest in kudzu centers on its use as therapy for alcoholism, although sufficient and consistent clinical trials are lacking. Estrogenic activity of kudzu is also being investigated, although clinical trials are limited."
151,L-arginine,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesL-arginine is a nonessential amino acid that may play an important role in the treatment of heart disease due to its block arterial plaque buildup, blood clots, platelet clumping, and to increase blood flow through the coronary artery. L-arginine is commonly sold as a health supplement claiming to improve vascular health and treat erectile dysfunction in men. L-arginine, which is promoted as a human growth stimulant, has also been used in bodybuilding. In the 1800s, it was first isolated from animal horn."
152,L-Theanine,"
L-Theanine is used by some people to help lower anxiety and as a sleep aid. Others believe it helps with the immune system. Some people believe it may help prevent cancer. L-Theanine is used by some people to help relax."
153,L-Tryptophan,"
L-Tryptophan is also known as tryptophan. It is used by some people to help with sleeping problems. Others may use it to help stop smoking. Some people believe it may help with problems like low mood or attention deficit disorder. Women may take this product to help with mood problems that go along with their periods."
154,Lavender,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesLavender has been used for pain, bacterial and fungal infections, depression, cramps, indigestion, to promote wound healing, and as a sedative. Extracts have been used to treat conditions ranging from acne to migraines. Although the plant has been known to increase bile flow output and flow into the intestine, its greatest value is not in the treatment of liver conditions. Lavender has been used extensively for diabetes in parts of Spain and is included in some commercial herbal antidiabetic preparations. Fresh leaves and flowers are applied to the forehead to relieve headaches and to joints to treat rheumatic pain. The vapors of steamed flowers are used as a cold remedy. Chileans drink the tea to induce or increase menstrual flow.General usesLavender has been used for restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, diabetes, GI distress, discomfort following childbirth, cancer, as an insect repellant, and as a food flavoring agent. However, there are limited clinical trials to support any of these uses."
155,Lecithin,"
Lecithin is used by some people to help lower cholesterol. Others use it to help with mental or nerve problems. Others use lecithin as a skin moisturizer."

Others believe it may help with heartburn. Lemon balm may be used to help with colic. It may also help with Alzheimer disease."
157,Lemon Verbena,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesLemon verbena has been used as a medicinal plant for centuries to stop muscle spasms, as a fever reducer and sedative, for indigestion, and to increase appetite, among other indications. Research regarding its medicinal use is limited. The leaves and flowering tops are used in teas and as beverage flavors. Its fragrance is used in perfumery.General usesLemon verbena extract has demonstrated antioxidant activity and the essential oil has shown antimicrobial properties, but there is no evidence for clinical use."
158,Licorice,"
Licorice is used by some people to help with stomach and bowel problems like ulcers or heartburn. Others use it to help with infections. Some people believe licorice will help protect your liver or protect you from cancer. Some people use licorice to help with hot flashes that happen in menopause."
159,Linden,"Linden has been used to induce sweating for feverish colds and infections, to reduce nasal congestion, and relieve throat irritation and cough. Linden has sedative effects and has been used to treat nervous palpitations and high blood pressure. It has also been added as an ingredient in lotions to relieve itchy skin. However, there is limited clinical information to support these uses.Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesSince the Middle Ages, the flowers of the linden tree have been used to promote sweating. Traditionally, the flowers have been used to treat flu, cough, migraine, nervous tension, ingestion, various types of spasms, liver and gall bladder disorders, diarrhea, and elevated arterial pressure associated with arteriosclerosis. Infusions of the flowers make a pleasant-tasting tea. Linden flowers were once believed so effective in treating epilepsy that one could be cured simply by sitting beneath the tree. In Greek mythology, ""Philyra,"" a nymph, was transformed into a linden tree after begging the gods not to leave her among mortals."
160,Lobelia,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAmerican Indians smoked the leaves as tobacco and used them medicinally for respiratory illnesses. Lobelia was introduced into New England medical practice in the 18th century to produce vomiting. It was also used in treating colic, rheumatism, fever, and asthma. By the 19th century, lobelia was considered an important medicinal plant used in many conditions (eg, abscess, insomnia, tetanus, shock); however, deaths were recorded due to dosing inconsistencies. In 1993, the sale of lobelia over-the-counter (OTC) products for smoking cessation was prohibited by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).General usesLobelia inflata has been used in smoking cessation programs and has been proposed for treatment of other drug dependencies; however, clinical evidence is limited."

164,Ma Huang,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMa huang is one of the earliest and best known drugs of Chinese traditional medicine, referenced in the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, one of the foundation books of Chinese medicine (about 100 AD). It was and still is used to induce perspiration and to treat the symptoms of bronchial asthma, colds, and influenza.Chemical investigations of ephedra in the early 20th century resulted in the isolation of the alkaloids ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which were identified as the major pharmacologically active compounds in the aboveground portions of the plant.Miscellaneous usesWhile asthma treatment is one of the classical clinical uses for pure ephedrine as a pharmaceutical drug, dietary supplements promote ephedra as the herb for weight loss and increasing athletic performance. Ephedra has been a major component of herbal supplements for weight loss and athletic performance, often with caffeine also added. However, many manufacturers have recently reformulated products to remove ephedra because of legal liability questions. Because of its potential serious side effects, its use is not recommended."
165,Maca,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMaca was domesticated at least 1,300 to 2,000 years ago and has been used commonly as a food by native Andean people because of its high nutritional value as well as to enhance fertility and sexual performance. Indigenous people used maca to treat numerous conditions including anemia, tuberculosis, sterility, and fatigue. Ethnobotanical studies document the use of maca for depression, and cancer, as well as for menstrual and sexual disorders.The tuberous hypocotyl, or root, of the plant may be eaten raw or cooked, and dried and stored for years without serious deterioration. The root has a tangy taste and an aroma similar to that of butterscotch. Dried root may be mixed with honey or fruits to prepare juices, gelatins, jams, and alcoholic beverages.General usesNumerous studies on the aphrodisiac and fertility-enhancing properties of maca are documented in scientific literature."
166,Maitake,"Miscellaneous UsesMaitake has been used for its antiviral action and to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity. Maitake has been studied to a limited extent for treating cancer; however, the information available is not sufficient to recommend it for this use. The mushroom not only stimulates the immune system, but also has been tested in hypertension and HIV therapies.Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn China and Japan, maitake mushrooms have been consumed for 3,000 years, valued for their legendary properties. Maitake's scientific name, Grifola frondosa, is derived from an Italian mushroom name referring to a mythological beast, half lion and half eagle. Years ago in Japan, the maitake had monetary value and was worth its weight in silver. In the late 1980s, Japanese scientists determined that the maitake was more potent than shiitake, suehirotake, and kawaratake mushrooms, all of which are used in traditional Asian medicine for immune function enhancement."
167,Marijuana,"

169,Maté,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesYerba maté infusion has been used for centuries in folk medicine as a stimulant against physical and mental weakness, and for treating liver and digestive diseases, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and rheumatism. Yerba maté was used as a beverage for it depurative (to promote cleansing and excretion of waste), stimulant, and diuretic properties by the native people of Brazil and Paraguay. The plant Ilex paraguariensis first was cultivated by Jesuit missionaries in these regions. Consumption of maté is common in Brazil south of the Amazon River and in Paraguay and Argentina. In those areas, the beverage largely replaces coffee and tea. Raw leaves are not consumed, but are harvested from May through September and flash heated to halt enzymatic processes. The leaves are then wood smoked, dried, and aged—processes that alter the chemical composition and flavor of the resultant powdered leaves. Traditionally, yerba maté is served in a small gourd called a maté and consumed through a drinking tube, or bombilla, with a filter attached to the lower end to prevent consumption of the leaf fragments. Burnt sugar, lemon juice, or milk may be used to flavor the infusion.General usesMaté has been traditionally used as a caffeine- and vitamin-containing beverage for its stimulant, diuretic, and cleansing properties. Effects against cancer and hardening of the arteries have also been suggested, as well as weight-reduction properties. Clinical trials are limited."
170,Meadowsweet,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn 1597, botanist John Gerard noted that the smell of meadowsweet ""delighteth the senses."" In 1652, English physician Nicholas Culpeper wrote about the plant's therapeutic effects on the stomach. In 1682, meadowsweet was mentioned in a Dutch herbal. Queen Elizabeth I adorned her apartments with meadowsweet. The flowers were used to flavor alcoholic beverages in England and Scandinavian countries. In the Middle Ages, meadowsweet was known as ""meadwort"" because it was used to flavor mead, an alcoholic drink made by fermenting honey and fruit juices. In 1838, salicylic acid, first synthesized in the 1890s to make aspirin, was isolated from the plant. The word ""aspirin"" is derived from ""spirin,"" based on meadowsweet's scientific name, ""Spiraea."" The plant was used in folk medicine for cancer, tumors, rheumatism, and as a diuretic. Today, it is used as a digestive remedy, as supportive therapy for colds, for analgesia, and for other indications.Miscellaneous usesMeadowsweet has been used for colds, respiratory problems, acid indigestion, peptic ulcers, arthritis and rheumatism, skin diseases, and diarrhea."

174,Mistletoe,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMistletoe preparations have been used medicinally in Europe for centuries to treat epilepsy, infertility, hypertension, and arthritis. The Celtic priests, known as Druids, revered the oak tree and the mistletoe that grew on it, according to Roman author and naturalist Gaius Plinius Secundus (also known as Pliny the Elder). At the winter celebration of Samhain, the sacred oaks were bare except for the green boughs of mistletoe, and this was taken as a sign of eternal fertility. The Celts placed a sprig of mistletoe above the door of their houses and its sacred nature prohibited fighting beneath it. This evolved over centuries into the custom of kissing underneath mistletoe at Christmas. In 1921, the Austrian anthroposophical spiritual leader Rudolf Steiner suggested that mistletoe might be used to treat cancer, based on the observation that mistletoe, like cancer, is parasitic and lethal to its host. Swiss and German clinics were founded to implement this idea and still actively use a mistletoe preparation fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 3 days. Mistletoe extracts contain several toxic proteins, several of which are lectins, or proteins capable of binding to specific sugars.General usesMistletoe has been used to treat cancer, although there is a lack of quality clinical trials and no evidence of an effect. Most evidence is ancedotal and based on case reports. Further study is needed. In folk medicine, it has been used for its cardiovascular properties, but its clinical efficacy has not been established. Injectable mistletoe extract is widely used in Europe but is not licensed for use in the United States."
175,Muira Puama,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe promotion of muira puama as a male sexual stimulant or as a treatment for erectile dysfunction can be traced back to the 1930s in Europe, but its popularity has increased with the success of Viagra (sildenafil) and the promotion of herbal sildenafil preparations. It is also an ingredient of the popular Brazilian herbal tonic Catuama, consisting of guarana, ginger, Trichilia catigua, and P. olacoides. The stems and roots of P. olacoides have been used as a tonic for nerve and muscle problems. A root mixture is used externally in massages and baths for paralysis and beriberi (disease in which the body does not have enough thiamine [vitamin B1]). Tea made from the roots has been used for erectile dysfunction, rheumatism, and GI problems.General usesClinical evidence to support the effects of P. olacoides on sexual dysfunction is limited. More focus is now on potential use in Alzheimer or similar conditions of mental decline. Studies in rodents demonstrated improved memory and reversal of mental impairment; however, clinical trials are limited."
176,Mullein,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMullein boasts an illustrious history as a favored herbal remedy and, consequently, has found use in various disorders. Its traditional uses generally have focused on the management of respiratory disorders where it was used to treat asthma, coughs, tuberculosis, and related respiratory problems. However, in its various forms, the plant has been used to treat hemorrhoids, burns, bruises, and gout. Preparations of the plant have been ingested, applied topically, and smoked. The yellow flowers once were used as a source of yellow hair dye. In Appalachia, the plant has been used to treat colds and the boiled root administered for croup. Leaves were applied topically to soften and protect the skin. An oil derived from the flowers has been used to soothe earaches.Miscellaneous usesThere is little evidence to indicate that the plant can offer more than mild astringent and topical soothing effects. It may have mild demulcent properties when ingested. Mullein has expectorant and cough suppressant properties that make it useful for symptomatic treatment of sore throat and cough. Antiviral activity of mullein has been reported against herpes and influenza. Clinical research is lacking."
177,Myrrh,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesMyrrh has been used for centuries as incense and for medicinal purposes. Medicinally, it has been used as an astringent, antiseptic, antiparasitic, antitussive, emmenagogue, and antispasmodic agent. It was commonly included in mixtures used to treat worms, wounds, and sepsis during the 4th century BC. Myrrh has also been reported to treat gout, headache, jaundice, throat ailments, indigestion, fatigue, and paralysis.

All plant parts are used for a variety of illnesses in Samoan culture, and noni is one of the most frequently used Hawaiian plant medicines. Claims that have not been proven in clinical trials include: the use of bark for the treatment of bacterial infections, cough, diarrhea in infants, and stomach ailments; the flowers for sore or irritated eyes, styes, conjunctivitis, ocular inflammation, and coughs; the fruit for asthma, wounds, broken bones, mouth and throat infections, tuberculosis, worms, diarrhea, fever, vomiting, eye ailments, arthritis, depression, seizures, bacterial and fungal infections, viruses, and as a tonic; the fresh fruit juice for cancer; the dried leaves used externally for infections, burns, children's chest colds, and inflammation, and internally for boils, pleurisy, inflamed gums, and arthritic pain; the fresh leaves used externally for burns and internally for fevers, hemorrhage, bacterial infections, and inflammation; and the roots for oral ulcerations, fevers, and cancerous swellings."
181,Oats,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesDerived from wild grasses, the oat was domesticated into today's cultivated plant. The oldest known oat grains were found in Egyptian remains from about 2000 BC. Scottish settlers introduced oats into North America in the early 17th century. Before being used as a food for humans, oats were used as a livestock feed in the form of grain, pasture, hay, or silage. Traditional medicinal uses of oats include the treatment of rheumatism, depression, chronic nerve pain, and loss of bladder control, and, externally, as a skin cleanser and softener.General usesOats and oatmeal are used primarily as a food source. Use in celiac disease is debated. Benefits in dermatology, high cholesterol, heart conditions, and diabetes remain controversial."

Symbolically, the olive branch stands for peace. The leaves were worn by athletes in ancient Olympic Games. Medicinal uses of the plant in the 1800s included malaria treatment.General usesInterest in olive leaf use centers on antioxidant and antiviral activity, as well as its possible role in diabetes and heart/blood vessel conditions. However, clinical trials do not support its use for any indication."
183,Olive Oil,"
Olive oil is used by some people to lower cholesterol and improve heart health. Others use it as a laxative. Some people believe it protects from cancer. Others will use it to help skin conditions. Others believe it helps with arthritis or high blood pressure."
184,Onion,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesCentral and western Asia is believed to be the region where onions were domesticated. Onions were pictured as early as 5,000 years ago on ancient Egyptian monuments. Ancient Greek and Roman writings also refer to the onion. During the Middle Ages, onions were consumed throughout Europe. They later were thought to guard against evil spirits and the plague, probably because of their strong odor. Onion skin dye has been used for egg and cloth coloring for many years in the Middle East and Europe. Columbus was said to have brought the onion to America. Folk healers used the onion to prevent infection. The combination of onions and garlic cooked in milk is a European folk remedy used to clear congestion. Onion has potential in treating heart disease, hyperglycemia, and stomach cancer, although few quality clinical trials are available to support these uses. Topical preparations have been evaluated to prevent surgical scarring with varying success."
185,Oregano,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesOregano has been a common ingredient in Spanish, Mexican, and Italian dishes as a spice and flavoring agent for hundreds of years. Its initial purpose was as a warming digestive and circulatory stimulant. It also has been used in perfumery, especially in the scenting of soaps. The antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since ancient times.Antispasmodic, sedative, indigestion, sweating, and stimulant actions have been reported. An infusion of the fresh herb may have beneficial effects on an upset stomach, headache, colic, and nervous complaints, as well as on coughs and other respiratory ailments. An infusion of the flowers is said to prevent seasickness. The oil is also used externally in liniments and lotions and to ease toothache.

187,Papaya,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPapaya, a tropical plant believed to have originated in southern Mexico and Central America, is now cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. C. papaya is cultivated for its edible ripe fruit; its juice is a popular beverage, and its young leaves, shoots, and fruits are cooked as a vegetable. The fruits are a source of flavoring used in candies, jellies, preserves, and ice cream. Shallow cuts on the surface of fully grown but unripe fruits cause a milky sap or latex to ooze that is collected, dried, and termed ""crude papain."" Papain has many industrial uses, as well as milk-clotting (rennet) and protein-digesting properties. Nearly 80% of American beer is treated with papain, which allows the beer to remain clear upon cooling. Papain is most commonly used commercially in meat tenderizers and chewing gums. Cosmetically, papain is used in some toothpastes, shampoos, and facial creams.Miscellaneous usesPapaya has been used widely in folk medicine for many ailments: the juice for warts, corns, cancers, tumors, and thickened skin; the roots or their extracts for cancers of the uterus, syphilis, the tropical infection, hemorrhoids, and to remove mineral concretions in the urine; the unripe fruit as a mild laxative or diuretic, and to stimulate lactation, labor, or abortion; the ripe fruit for rheumatism and alkalinizing the urine; the seeds for intestinal worms or to stimulate menstruation or abortion; the leaves as a poultice for nervous pains and elephantoid growths, or smoked for asthma relief; and the latex for psoriasis, ringworm, indigestion, or applied externally as an antiseptic or to heal burns or scalds, or applied to the cervix to contract the uterus.General usesIn some developing countries, the traditional use of papaya is being investigated as an alternative to standard treatments for a range of ailments. C. papaya has a wide range of purported medicinal properties for treatment of diabetes, as birth control, as an antiseptic, antimicrobial, or diuretic, to control parasites, reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, and lower cholesterol. While there are only limited data to support most of these uses, there is some evidence for healing bed sores and other wounds and in treating intestinal worms in humans."
188,Parsley,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesParsley leaves and roots are popular as condiments and garnish worldwide. In Lebanon, parsley is a major ingredient in the national dish tabbouleh. An average adult may consume as much as 50 g of parsley per meal.Miscellaneous usesParsley has been used as a source of certain vitamins and minerals. Parsley seed was used traditionally as a carminative to decrease flatulence and colic pain. The root was used as a diuretic and the juice to treat kidney ailments. Parsley oil also has been used to regulate menstrual flow in the treatment of amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea, and is purported to be an abortive. Bruised leaves have been used to treat tumors, insect bites, lice, skin parasites, and contusions. At one time, parsley tea was used to treat dysentery and gallstones. Other reported traditional uses include treatment of diseases of the prostate, liver, and spleen. Historically, parsley also has been used in the treatment of anemia, arthritis, and cancers, as an expectorant, antimicrobial, aphrodisiac, hypotensive, diuretic, and laxative.

191,Pennyroyal,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPennyroyal has been recorded in history as far back as the first century AD, when it was mentioned by Roman naturalist Pliny and Greek physician Dioscorides. In the 17th century, English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper wrote about some uses for the plant including its role in women's ailments, venomous bites, and digestion. European settlers used the plant for respiratory ailments, mouth sores, and female disorders. The plant's oil has been used as a flea-killing bath, hence the name pulegioides (from the Latin word meaning flea), and has been used externally as a rubefacient (counter-irritant). In addition, the oil has found frequent use among natural health advocates as an abortive and as a means of inducing delayed menses. The oil and infusions of the leaves have been used in the treatment of weakness and stomach pains.Miscellaneous usesPennyroyal has been used as an insect repellent, antiseptic, fragrance, flavoring, as an emmenagogue (to stimulate menstrual flow), carminative, stimulant, antispasmodic and for bowel disorders, skin eruptions, and pneumonia. The abortive effect of the oil is thought to be caused by irritation of the uterus with subsequent uterine contraction. Its action is unpredictable and dangerous. The dose at which the herb induces abortion is close to lethal, and in some cases it is lethal. Pennyroyal is not considered safe for ingestion for any use."
192,Peppermint,"
Peppermint oil is used by some people to help with irritable bowel syndrome. It can help to decrease upset stomach, bloating, or gas.

An extensive body of literature exists on the clinical uses of the various purified alkaloids of Catharanthus."
194,Peru Balsam,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesCrude Peru balsam is a dark brown, thick liquid with an aromatic smell similar to that of cinnamon and vanilla and a bitter taste. It is obtained from the tree after the bark has been removed; the trunk is wrapped with rags that are later boiled to extract the resin.The balsam was imported almost exclusively from El Salvador to Europe through Peruvian ports, which is how the material derived its name. Central and South American natives used the material to stop bleeding and promote wound healing, and also to increase urination and to expel worms. It was once used widely as a treatment for scabies; it has also been used in suppositories for hemorrhoids and in dentistry in the treatment of ""dry socket"" after teeth are pulled, and in dental impression material. Today, the material is in a number of pharmaceutical preparations and plays an important role in perfumes. The material should not be swallowed.General usesPeru balsam has been used in the treatment of dry socket in dentistry, on the skin as a treatment for wounds and ulcers, and in suppositories for hemorrhoids. However, there are only older, small studies to support these uses."
195,Pineapple,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe pineapple is native to South America and was brought to Europe by Spanish explorers. Planting began on a large scale in Hawaii early in the 19th century. Growth of the industry peaked in the 1950s, then declined slowly under the pressure of international competition. Today, the bulk of the world's pineapple crop comes from Thailand, the Philippines, and Brazil. Traditional uses include the brewing of pineapple wine, production of fiber, and medicinal use to induce menstruation, induce abortion, kill parasitic amoebas, and expel worms.General usesFew well-controlled clinical trials have been published to support the wide range of therapeutic claims for bromelain, a crude, aqueous extract of pineapple. Evidence exists primarily for the use of bromelain in debridement of burns and as an anti-inflammatory agent."
196,Plantain,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesPlantain has long been associated with agriculture. Certain species have been spread by human colonization, particularly that of Europeans. As such, North American Indians and New Zealand Maori refer to plantain as ""Englishman's foot,"" because it spread from areas of English settlement. P. lanceolata and P. major have been used in herbal remedies and sometimes were carried to colonies intentionally for that purpose. Psyllium seed has been found in malt refuse (formerly used as fertilizer) and wool imported to England. It has been commonly used in birdseed. Pulverized seeds are mixed with oil and applied topically to inflamed sites. Decoctions have been mixed with honey for sore throats. The seeds and refined colloid are used commonly in commercial bulk laxative preparations.Miscellaneous usesThe psyllium in plantain has been used as GI therapy, to treat hyperlipidemia, for anticancer effects, and for respiratory treatment. In human studies, plantain has been effective for chronic bronchitis, asthma, cough, and cold. Clinical studies show that psyllium seed is useful as a bulk laxative. Many reports on psyllium have concluded that it can be helpful in treating various hyperlipidemias. A polyphenolic compound from P. major leaves was found to exhibit cholesterol-lowering activity. In addition, the mechanism by which plantago reduces cholesterol also may include enhancement of cholesterol elimination as fecal bile acids. Research reveals no information regarding the use of plantain as an anticancer agent."

210,Rosemary,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesRosemary is a widely used culinary spice. Tradition holds that rosemary will grow only in gardens of households where the ""mistress"" is truly the ""master."" The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent, tonic, carminative, antispasmodic, and diaphoretic properties. Rosemary is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs, used centuries ago to enhance mental function and memory. Extracts and the volatile oil have been used to promote menstrual flow and as abortives. Rosemary extracts commonly are found as cosmetic ingredients and a lotion of the plant is said to stimulate hair growth and prevent baldness.Miscellaneous usesRosemary is a known antimicrobial agent. The powdered leaves are used as an effective natural flea and tick repellent. Rosemary oil possesses marked antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Rosemary oil was found to be most active against ""meat-spoiling"" bacteria. A report on the use of rosemary to treat head lice found it to be ineffective.There are numerous reports available evaluating rosemary's anticancer effects. The extract induces an anticarcinogenic enzyme. Other anticancer mechanisms include polyphenol constituents that inhibit metabolic activation of procarcinogens. Rosemary has been reported to decrease capillary permeability and fragility. The plant may have spasmolytic actions, liver, and immune effects. Rosemary also may reverse headaches, reduce stress, and aid in asthma and bronchitis treatment. Rosemary also is used in aromatherapy for chronic pain treatment. Several reports exist concerning rosemary's antioxidative actions. Rosemary antioxidants have less scavenging potential than green tea polyphenols, but have more potential than vitamin E.While research is promising, more clinical testing will need to be done to validate all the medicinal uses of rosemary."
211,Royal Jelly,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesBecause of their specialized nutrition, queen bees differ from workers in several ways. The queens are approximately twice the size, they lay approximately 2,000 eggs a day (female worker bees are infertile), and they live 5 to 8 years (approximately 40 times longer than worker bees).These differences have led to the marketable assumption that ingestion of this product will do as much for humans as it does for bees; that is, increase size, improve fertility, and enhance longevity. In many countries, royal jelly has been promoted widely as a commercially available medicine, health food, and as a cosmetic (as an emollient, moisturizer, and nourishing substance). It is used in traditional medicine for longevity in Europe and Asia. Royal jelly has been sold as a skin tonic and hair growth stimulant.General usesRoyal jelly has been studied for a variety of actions, including antibiotic, antitumor, lowering blood pressure, and regulating the immune system. Additionally, effects on cholesterol, insulin-like action, and on the nervous system and female hormonal activity have been demonstrated. However, clinical trials are lacking."
212,Safflower,"
Safflower is used by some people as a laxative or to help with itching. Others use it to help lower cholesterol levels. Some people believe it may help with diabetes."
213,Saffron,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesSaffron has been used widely for flavoring food and as a dye for cloth, which it continues to be used for in underdeveloped countries and among back-to-basics artisans. Folkloric uses of saffron included its use as a sedative, expectorant, aphrodisiac, and diaphoretic (to induce perspiration). Anecdotal reports from the tropical regions of Asia describe the use of a paste composed of sandalwood and saffron as a soothing balm for dry skin. During the 16th through the 19th centuries, saffron was used in various opioid preparations for pain relief. Laudanum contained sherry wine, opium, saffron, cinnamon, and cloves. Black-drop contained opium, nutmeg, saffron, and yeast.Miscellaneous usesSaffron may possess antitumor activity. Chemopreventive (cancer preventive) studies examining the efficacy of saffron need to be performed. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of saffron for contraception or anti-inflammatory effects."
214,SAMe,"
Samesadenosylmethionine is also known as SAMe. It is used by some people to help with low mood or Alzheimer disease. Others believe it helps with arthritis. Some use it to help with heart or liver problems. SAMe is used by some people to help with fibromyalgia or for sexual dysfunction."
215,Sandalwood,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesSandalwood oil has a warm, woody odor and is commonly used as a fragrance in incense, cosmetics, perfumes, and soaps. It also is used as a flavor for foods and beverages. The wood has been valued in carving because of its dense character.In traditional medicine, sandalwood oil has been used as an antiseptic and astringent, and for the treatment of headache, stomachache, and urinary and genital disorders. In India, the essential oil, emulsion, or paste of sandalwood is used in the treatment of inflammatory and eruptive skin diseases. The oil has been used in the traditional Ayurvedic medicinal system as a diuretic and mild stimulant, and for smoothing the skin. The leaves and bark were used by early Hawaiians to treat dandruff, lice, skin inflammation, and sexually transmitted diseases. Sandalwood oil has also demonstrated repellency against the crop pest Tetranychus urticae (two-spotted spider mite).General usesSandalwood oil has been reported to have diuretic and urinary antiseptic properties, but clinical trial data are lacking. The oil has mainly been used as a fragrance enhancer."
216,Sarsaparilla,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe Spanish physician Nicholas Monardes described using sarsaparilla to treat syphilis in 1574. In 1812, Portuguese soldiers suffering from syphilis recovered faster if sarsaparilla was taken to treat the disease instead of mercury, the standard treatment at the time. Sarsaparilla has been used by many cultures for other ailments as well, including skin problems, arthritis, fever, digestive disorders, leprosy, and cancer. Late 15th century accounts explaining the identification and the first descriptions of American drugs include sarsaparilla. Sarsaparilla's role as a medicinal plant in American and European remedies in the 16th century also is evident.Sarsaparilla has been used for treating syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) throughout the world and was documented as an add-on treatment for leprosy in 1959.General usesExtracts of the roots may be effective in treating gout and metabolic syndrome (a combination of conditions, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol); however, evidence is based largely on animal studies and clinical trials are limited. Sarsaparilla has been traditionally used for treating syphilis, leprosy, and psoriasis; however, evidence to support these uses is lacking. Interest in cell-killing potential in treating cancer exists."
217,Sarsparilla,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical uses
The French physician Nicholas Monardes described using sarsaparilla to treat syphilis in 1574. In 1812, Portuguese soldiers suffering from syphilis recovered faster if sarsaparilla was taken to treat the disease instead of mercury, the standard treatment at the time. Sarsaparilla has been used by many cultures for other ailments as well, including skin problems, arthritis, fever, digestive disorders, leprosy, and cancer. Late 15th century accounts explaining the identification and the first descriptions of American drugs include sarsaparilla. Sarsaparilla's role as a medicinal plant in American and European remedies in the 16th century also is evident.
Sarsaparilla has been used for treating syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) throughout the world for 40 years. It has been used for psoriasis, and was documented as an adjuvant for leprosy treatment in 1959.
Miscellaneous uses
The ability of sarsaparilla to bind to endotoxins may be a possible mechanism of action as to how the plant exerts its effects. Problems associated with high endotoxin levels circulating in the blood stream such as liver disease, psoriasis, fevers, and inflammatory processes, all seem to improve with sarsaparilla. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sarsaparilla for anti-inflammatory effects. A recent review addresses smilax compounds present in bodybuilding supplements said to “enhance performance.” Results of the study of more than 600 commercially available supplements determined that there was no research to validate these claims."
218,Sassafras,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesNative Americans have used sassafras for centuries and told early settlers that it would cure a variety of illnesses. The settlers then exported it to Europe, where it was found ineffective. A report on experiences of explorers and doctors finding, identifying, and describing sassafras bark and other drugs during the late 16th century is available.Over the years, the oil obtained from the roots and wood has been used as a scent in perfumes and soaps. Medicinally, sassafras has been applied to insect bites and stings to relieve symptoms. The leaves and pith, when dried and powdered, have been used as a thickener in soups. The roots often are dried and steeped for tea, and sassafras formerly was used as a flavoring in root beer. The pleasant-tasting oil of sassafras comes from the roots and the root bark. The main constituent of the oil is safrole. Sassafras oil and safrole have been banned for use as a drug and as flavors and food additives by the FDA because of their carcinogenic potential. However, their use and sale persist throughout the US."
219,Saw Palmetto,"
Saw palmetto is used by some men to help with signs of an enlarged prostate. This is called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH. Some men also use it to help slow prostate cancer growth. Some people use it to help with hair loss."
220,Schisandra,"
Schisandra is used by some people to help protect the liver from harm.  Others use it to help with alertness and to increase energy levels. It may also be used to help with low mood. Some people use it to help with problems sleeping. Schisandra may be used by some people to help with breathing problems like coughs, wheezing, or shortness of breath. Others believe it will help the body adapt to stress and protect from diseases."
221,Scullcap,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesScullcap appears to have been introduced into traditional American medicine toward the end of the 1700s, when it was promoted as an effective treatment for the management of hydrophobia (hence the derivation of one of its common names). It later was used as a tonic, particularly in proprietary remedies for ""female weakness."" The plant had been reputed to be an herbal tranquilizer, particularly in combination with Valerian, but has fallen into disuse. Scullcap has traditionally been used to treat nervousness, irritability, and neuralgia, as well as for its sedative properties.Miscellaneous usesOne clinical study indicates some anti-anxiety properties of scullcap. Recent studies also suggest that it might have anti-inflammatory activity. The depressant and antihypertensive effects of scullcap also have been looked at in a few small animal studies with no conclusive results. Teas prepared from Scutellaria species have demonstrable antibacterial and antifungal activity."
222,Seaweed,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesFor centuries, seaweed has been of botanical, industrial, and pharmaceutical interest. Because of the high nutrient content, seaweed has been used as a food throughout Asia.Traditional Chinese medicine used hot water extracts of certain seaweeds in the treatment of cancer. Additionally, the Japanese and Chinese cultures have used seaweeds to treat goiter and other glandular problems since 300 BC.The Romans used seaweeds in the treatment of wounds, burns, and rashes. The Celts noted that ordinary seaweed contracted as it dried and then expanded with moisture. In Scotland during the 18th century, physicians used dried seaweed stem to successfully drain abdominal wall abscesses. They also inserted seaweed into the cervix in an attempt to treat dysmenorrhea. Many reports outline the use of seaweed to induce abortion. Seaweed was employed intravaginally for ripening of the cervix and was used rectally for strictures.General usesThere are few clinical trials to support therapeutic recommendations for seaweeds. However, seaweeds are an important source of minerals and are low in sodium. They may be useful in heart conditions due to cholesterol reduction and appetite suppression. Alginates extracted from seaweed have been used in wound dressings."
223,Senna,"
Senna is used by some people as a laxative. It may also be used as a treatment for hard stools. Some people will take senna before having diagnostic tests on the bowels. Others will take it to help with weight loss."
224,Serrapeptase,"
Serrapeptase is an enzyme that is used by some people as medicine. Science currently does not support the use of this product for any health problems."
225,Shark Derivatives,"AnticancerEarly claims were made that extracts of shark cartilage inhibited tumors. The rationale includes the fact that sharks rarely get cancer, that sharks are cartilaginous fish and that cartilage is avascular (without blood vessels) and contains agents that inhibit vascularization (blood vessel genesis). The reasoning then follows that sharks do not get cancer because the inhibited vascularization prevents the formation of tumors. Hence, giving it to humans may inhibit tumor angiogenesis and cure cancer.The active principle(s) has not been found, although some believe it might be a protein. The shark cartilage was thought to be a cancer control agent. Several studies have been done on various sharks, but none have proven this theory. Clinical studies must be undertaken to prove any of the anticancer effects of shark derivatives.Other usesSqualamine has been used as a potent antibiotic with fungicidal and antiprotozoal activity."
226,Shark Liver Oil,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesIn 1916, squalene was isolated from SLO. Initially, SLO was used by Scandinavian fishermen to treat skin conditions, lung ailments, and certain cancers. The oil has been historically used to treat what was referred to as ""glandular disease"" that today most likely would be called lymphadenopathy. The active components alkylglycerols have been studied in a number of areas, including to stimulate the immune system.General usesSLO has been used to help treat cancer, skin conditions, and respiratory ailments, as well as to reduce recurrent mouth ulcers and prevent radiation sickness. However, limited clinical data are available. Alkylglycerols have been studied as an immune system stimulant. Animal data suggest SLO may improve fertility."
227,Slippery Elm,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesNorth American Indians and early settlers used the inner bark of the slippery elm not only to build canoes, shelter, and baskets, but as a poultice or as a soothing drink. Upon contact with water, the inner bark, collected in spring, yields a thick mucilage or demulcent that was used as an ointment or salve to treat urinary tract inflammation and was applied topically for cold sores and boils. A decoction of the leaves was used as a poultice to remove discoloration around blackened or bruised eyes. Surgeons during the American Revolution treated gun-shot wounds in this manner. Early settlers boiled bear fat with the bark to prevent rancidity. Late in the 19th century, a preparation of elm mucilage was officially recognized in the United States Pharmacopoeia.Demulcent/ProtectantSlippery elm prepared as a poultice coats and protects irritated tissues such as skin or intestinal membranes. The powdered bark has been used in this manner for local application to treat gout, rheumatism, cold sores, wounds, abscesses, ulcers, and toothaches. The tannins present are known to possess astringent actions. It also has been known to ""draw out"" toxins, boils, splinters, or other irritants.Powdered bark is incorporated into lozenges to provide demulcent action (soothing to mucous membranes) in the treatment of throat irritation. It also is used for its emollient and antitussive actions, to treat bronchitis and other lung afflictions, and to relieve thirst.GI/Urogenital effectsWhen slippery elm preparations are taken internally, they cause reflex stimulation of nerve endings in the GI tract, leading to mucus secretion. This may be the reason they are effective for protection against stomach ulcers, colitis, diverticulitis, gut inflammation, and acidity. Slippery elm also is useful for diarrhea, constipation, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome, and to expel tapeworms. It also has been used to treat cystitis and urinary inflammations.Other usesThe plant also is used as a lubricant to ease labor, as a source of nutrition for convalescence or baby food preparations, and for its activity against herpes and syphilis."
228,SOD,"Anti-inflammatoryWhite blood cells involved in the acute inflammatory response release large amounts of superoxide, which appears to contribute to the destruction of bacteria. Similarly, the amount of superoxide released at the site of an inflamed joint has been shown to cause extensive and rapid degradation of synovial fluid. SOD generally protects the fluid against this degradation. Furthermore, it protects the leucocytes themselves from free radical damage.Although IV infusion of SOD has little anti-inflammatory activity because of its rapid renal clearance, the local injection of SOD has proven to be an effective treatment for a variety of inflammatory disorders.Superoxide has been successfully used to treat human inflammatory diseases. In West Germany, where orgotein has been in general medical use for years, the drug is injected locally for the management of osteoarthritis, sports injuries, and knee joint osteoarthritis.SOD has been used for the treatment of soft tissue inflammation in horses and dogs, human inflammatory diseases, and chronic bladder inflammations. SOD is obtained for clinical use through genetically engineered biotechnology sources.Other usesSeveral reports have described an association between free radicals and aging. One researcher suggested that lifespans could be increased by 5 to 10 years by reducing body weight and increasing the levels of free-radical scavengers such as ascorbic acid, selenium and alpha-tocopherol. Some data indicate that longer-lived animal species have a higher internal degree of protection against free radicals.Based on such reports, some health food manufacturers have promoted products containing SOD as a nutritional supplement. These oral supplements have been said to remove wrinkles and age lines, slow the aging process, and facilitate a longer, healthier life.There are no published data to support these claims. SOD is a labile enzyme that is degraded rapidly by gastric acids when ingested. It is essentially unabsorbed after oral administration even when enteric coated, and confers no pharmacologic activity when taken orally. While many foods (red meats, vegetables) are rich in SOD, their SOD is degraded when ingested and is rendered enzymatically inactive."
229,Soy,"
Soy is used by some people to protect from certain kinds of cancer.  Others believe it will help lower cholesterol or protect from heart disease. Some people will use soy to help with diabetes, bone weakness, and for kidney problems. Women may use it to help with signs of menopause. Some people believe soy will help with loose stools in infants."
230,Spirulina,"
Spirulina is used by some people to help with allergies and asthma. Others believe it will help fight infections.  Some people believe it will help with cancer. Spirulina is used by some people to help with diabetes or high cholesterol levels. Others may use it to help with mouth sores. It may also be used to help with weight loss."
231,St. John's Wort,"
St. John's wort is used by some people to help with low mood and to reduce anxiety. Others use it to help with symptoms of premenstrual syndrome or menopause; cravings; and signs of withdrawal from alcohol, smoking, or other substances. Some people believe it helps treat infections and helps heal wounds."
232,Stevia,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesStevia has been used to sweeten tea for centuries, dating back to the Guarani Indians of South America. For hundreds of years, native Brazilians and Paraguayans also have employed the leaves of the plant as a sweetening agent. Europeans learned about stevia in the 16th century, whereas North American interest in the plant began in the 20th century when researchers heard of its sweetening properties. Paraguayan botanist Moises Bertoni documented stevia in the early 1900s. Glycosides responsible for the plant's sweetness were discovered in 1931. Stevia extracts are used today as food additives in Japan and Brazil as a non-caloric sweetener. In the US, however, use is limited to supplement status only.Sweetening agentStevia has been used for centuries as a natural sweetener. The plant contains sweet glycosides (eg, stevioside), with the most intense sweetness belonging to the species S. rebaudina. Stevia as a sweetening agent works well in weight-loss programs to satisfy ""sugar cravings,"" and is low in calories. The Japanese are the largest consumers of stevia leaves and employ the plant to sweeten foods, such as soy sauce, confections, and soft drinks, as a replacement for aspartame and saccharin.Other usesIn addition to its use as a sweetening agent, stevia also has been found to have hypotensive, hypoglycemic, and bactericidal properties. However, research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of stevia for any condition."
233,Sweet Wormwood,"
Sweet wormwood is used by some people to help with malaria or other infections. Some people use it to help stomach problems and to increase sexual desire. Others believe it may help with cancer."
234,Taheebo,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesTaheebo has been promoted for many years as an anticancer herb, and lay reports have claimed efficacy in a variety of cancers. However, there is sufficient scientific proof to support this use. Antifungal and antibiotic properties also are claimed in promotional literature, with topical and oral dosing for candidiasis. While taheebo shows some promise, no clinical trials have been conducted for any indication."
235,Taurine,"
Taurine is used by some people to help with seizures and some forms of autism. Some people believe it helps the heart and liver work better when you have congestive heart failure or hepatitis. It may help lower blood pressure or cholesterol. Others use it to protect the eyes from damage. Taurine may help keep blood sugar lower and increase mental performance."
236,Tea Tree Oil,"

Tylophora is used by some people to help with breathing problems like asthma, allergies, and the common cold. It may also help with swelling. Some people take tylophora for cancer or joint problems. It may help with loose stools, gas, or hemorrhoids. Others may apply tylophora to skin ulcers and wounds."
239,Tyrosine,"
Tyrosine is used by some people to help with low mood. People with a condition called phenylketonuria or PKU may use tyrosine. Others use it to help with addictions. Some people believe this product helps with conditions like stress, premenstrual syndrome, and attention deficit disorders (ADD). Others use it if they have problems staying awake or want to help them be more alert."
240,Ubiquinone,"
Ubiquinone is also known as Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10.  It is used by some people to improve heart function and treat heart failure. Others may use it to help lower high blood pressure. Some people believe CoQ10 will help with nerve problems in diseases like diabetes or migraines. Others may take it to help with muscle or nerve problems caused by not enough CoQ10."
241,Uva Ursi,"
Some people use uva ursi to help with problems with the urinary tract. Others believe it increases the amount of urine you pass. Some people use it to help with hard stools. Others will use uva ursi to help with a rash or breathing problems like bronchitis. People with arthritis may also use it to help with pain."

243,Vanadium,"
Vanadium is used by some people to help lower blood sugar levels. Others think it may help with tuberculosis, syphilis, low red blood cell count, or swelling. Some may use it to help them get stronger or to prevent cancer. Others may take it to help to lower cholesterol levels and prevent heart disease."
244,Vervain,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe aerial parts have been used traditionally for many conditions, including stimulation of lactation and treatment of dysmenorrhea, jaundice, gout, kidney stones, headache, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Vervain is also considered an astringent, a bitter digestive tonic, and a diuretic.General usesVervain has been used for many conditions, including stimulation of lactation and treatment of dysmenorrhea, jaundice, gout, kidney stones, and headache; however, there are few clinical trials of vervain or its components."
245,Vinpocetine,"
Vinpocetine is used by some people to help with signs of menopause, tiredness, or to prevent motion sickness. Some people will use it to protect from stomach ulcers. It may also be used to protect the brain from strokes or dementia. Vinpocetine may help with memory or to prevent Alzheimer's disease. Some people believe vinpocetine will help with seizures. Others may use it to protect from hearing loss associated with certain drugs. It may also be used to help manage pain."
246,Vitamin E,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesVitamin E was discovered in 1922 when reproductive abnormalities in rats reared on a basic diet were cured by a substance isolated from vegetable oils. A pure fraction was chemically identified in 1938 and named tocopherol after the Greek words tokos and phero meaning ""child birth"" and ""to bring forth.""General usesRoutine use of high-dose vitamin E for cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and epilepsy is not recommended. Vitamin E supplementation may have a role in treating age-related macular degeneration, dysmenorrhea, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis, and tardive dyskinesia. Topical use of vitamin E has been investigated for the reduction of scarring."
247,Walnut,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesWalnuts have been found in prehistoric deposits in Europe dating from the Iron Age and are mentioned in Old Testament references to King Solomon's nut garden. Many legends have been associated with the walnut; the ancient Greeks and Romans regarded them as symbols of fertility. In the Middle Ages, walnuts were thought to ward off witchcraft, the evil eye, and epileptic fits because of the belief that evil spirits lurked in the walnut branches.Historically, walnut oil was prescribed for colic, to soothe intestines, and to relieve diarrhea and hemorrhoids. Further folk uses include treating rickets, frostbite, and glandular disturbances, and as an astringent, tonic restorative, and disinfectant. Blisters, ulcers, itchy scalp/dandruff, sunburn, and perspiration are some of the conditions treated with various walnut preparations.General usesThe inclusion of walnuts in the diet is recommended as a dietary source of polyunsaturated fatty acids and other nutrients, and to improve the lipid profile in hyperlipidemic individuals. Cardiac benefits of walnut consumption are described. Walnuts have also been studied in metabolic syndrome with limited benefit demonstrated. The effect of walnut extract in Alzheimer disease is being investigated."

250,Wintergreen,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesAmerican Indians reportedly used wintergreen for treating back pain, rheumatism, fever, headaches, and sore throats. The plant and its oil have been used in traditional medicine as a pain releiver, for indigesion, and to protect the skin and reduce bleeding from minor cuts.Steam processing of the warmed, water-treated leaves produces wintergreen oil. It is used with sweet birch oil or a chemical compound (typically no more than 0.04%) for flavoring foods and candy.Wintergreen berries have been used to make pies. A tea made from the leaves was used as a substitute for black tea during the Revolutionary War. The tea has been used to relieve cold symptoms and muscle aches.General usesIn addition to being used as a flavoring, wintergreen and its oil have been used on the skin in preparations for the treatment of muscular and rheumatic pain. Clinical data do not support the use of wintergreen for any condition."
251,Witch Hazel,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesWitch hazel is a widely known plant with a lengthy history of use in the Americas. The plant, including the crude leaf and bark, is used in a variety of forms; fluid extracts, poultices, and most commonly as witch hazel water. The latter, also known as Hamamelis water or distilled witch hazel extract, is obtained from recently cut, partially dormant twigs. This plant material is soaked in warm water, followed by distillation and the addition of alcohol to the distillate. Witch hazel water is the most commonly found commercial preparation, usually kept in most homes as a topical cooling agent or astringent.Traditionally, witch hazel was known to native North American people as a treatment for tumors and eye inflammations. It was used internally for bleeding. Other uses include treatment of hemorrhoids, burns, cancers, tuberculosis, colds, and fever. Preparations have been used on the skin for treatment of itching and inflammation, as well as in preparations for eye irritation.General usesWitch hazel preparations are commonly used for skin conditions, including diaper rash; however, clinical studies supporting these uses are generally lacking. Witch hazel has been evaluated for antioxidant and antitumor activity."
252,Yarrow,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesYarrow is native to Europe and Asia, and has been naturalized in North America. Its use in food and medicine is ancient, dating back to the Trojan War, around 1200 BC. In legend, Achilles used it on the Centaur's advice, hence the name. In classical times, yarrow was referred to as ""herba militaris"" because it stopped bleeding wounds received in war. Yarrow leaves have been used for tea, and young leaves and flowers have been used in salads. Infusions of yarrow have served as cosmetic cleansers and medicines. Sneezewort leaves (A. ptarmica) have been used in sneezing powder, while those of A. millefolium have been used for snuff. Yarrow has been used therapeutically as a ""strengthening bitter tonic"" and astringent. Chewing fresh leaves has been suggested to relieve toothaches. Yarrow oil has been used in shampoos for a topical ""healing"" effect.Miscellaneous usesYarrow has been used to induce sweating and to stop wound bleeding. It also has been reported to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and pain. It has been used to relieve GI ailments, for cerebral and coronary thromboses, to lower high blood pressure, to improve circulation, and to tone varicose veins. It has antimicrobial actions, is a natural source for food flavoring, and is used in alcoholic beverages and bitters. Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of yarrow to treat any medical condition."
253,Yellow Dock,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe spring leaf stalks of this plant have been used as a potherb in salads but are disagreeable to some because of their tart sour-sweet taste. The plant must be boiled and rinsed thoroughly before being eaten. Due to its astringent properties, the plant has been used generally unsuccessfully in the treatment of venereal diseases and skin conditions. The powdered root has been used as a natural dentifrice. Larger amounts have been given as a laxative and tonic.While the roots of yellow dock are known to exert a laxative effect, research reveals no animal or clinical data regarding the use of yellow dock to treat any condition."
254,Yerba Santa,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesThe name yerba santa (""holy weed"") was given by the Spanish priests who learned of the medicinal value of the shrub from the American Indians. The plant has a long tradition of use in the United States. The thick sticky leaves, used either fresh or dried, were boiled to make tea or taken as treatment for coughs, colds, asthma, and tuberculosis. The leaves have been powdered and used as a stimulating expectorant. A liniment was applied topically to reduce fever. A poultice of fresh leaves was used to treat bruises, and young leaves were applied to relieve rheumatism. Historical evidence documents that yerba santa has been used in tea and medicinally for the management of bruises and rheumatic pain. The plant also has been used as an expectorant and in the treatment of respiratory diseases. Review of the scientific literature reveals no evidence evaluating the effectiveness of yerba santa for any condition in humans or animals.Miscellaneous usesThe plant is contained in a number of OTC herbal preparations. Yerba santa has been used as a pharmaceutical flavoring, particularly to mask the flavor of bitter drugs. The fluid extract is used in foods and beverages."
255,Yogurt,"ProbioticYogurt has been promoted to restore the GI flora after systemic antibiotic therapy and to alleviate anal pruritus, aphthous ulcers, and canker sores. The large number of bacteria in active yogurt (each milliliter of commercial brands contains about 125 million L. bulgaricus and 125 million S. thermophilus) may hasten colonization in the colon, thereby removing the reservoir of yeast infection. More than 3 decades ago, bacterial replacement therapy with live cultures was found to have no established value in the prevention or treatment of such disorders. Yogurt possesses intrinsic antibacterial activity, probably largely because of its lactic acid content. Lactic acid has demonstrated bactericidal activity against some organisms, but this is probably not the only factor in eliminating the bacteria.Cardiovascular and cholesterol reduction effectsFat loss and weight loss have been demonstrated with the use of yogurt. Enhanced calcium intake was proposed as the mechanism for this effect. Older studies have demonstrated a cholesterol-lowering effect with yogurt. Surveys suggest yogurt has a protective effect against coronary heart disease and elevated blood pressure.OsteoporosisOne human clinical study showed that the addition of yogurt to the diet significantly reduced a marker of bone resorption in menopausal women. Despite the debate that exists regarding the role of supplemental calcium in the prevention of osteoporosis, yogurt remains a recommended source of calcium.Anticancer effectsYogurt also may have some anticancer properties. Yogurt has a protective effect against some cancers in laboratory experiments, but convincing human data are not available.Other usesYogurt has been used as a substitute for milk for those who are lactose intolerant. Yogurt has been at the center of a controversy regarding milk products that can be tolerated by people with lactase deficiency. Studies are inconclusive. Reports by those with lactose intolerance and other bowel disorders indicate individual responses that often vary from study results.Yogurt also has been used to prevent recurring vaginal yeast infections. There has been some interest in the direct vaginal instillation of yogurt for the treatment of Candida infections. However, the clinical effects of this therapy have not been defined in well-controlled studies, and this practice cannot be widely recommended, particularly in pregnant women."
256,Yohimbe,"
Yohimbe is used by some people to lose weight and build muscles. Men may use it to help with erectile dysfunction. Both men and women may use it to increase sexual desire. Yohimbe may be used to help regulate blood pressure. Some people may use it to help with dry mouth, feeling tired, or low mood. Others may use it to help with chest pain or diabetic nerve pain."
257,Yucca,"Traditional/Ethnobotanical usesFor centuries, yucca plants have served American Indians for a variety of uses including fiber for rope, sandals and cloth; the roots have been used in soap. The Indians and early Californian settlers used the green pods for food. Indian uses included boiling and baking the fruits, eating the blossoms, chewing the raw leaves and fermenting the fruits to produce a beverage for rituals.Miscellaneous usesThe plant has been purported to be beneficial for treating colitis, hypertension, arthritis, and migraine headaches. One report found that the oral administration of daily doses of a yucca saponin extract was effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of various arthritic conditions. Interestingly, these patients also had significant reductions in blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels, and a reduction in the incidence of migraine headaches from baseline. This limited evidence suggests the extract may be effective in the management of arthritis, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. More clinical research is needed. Yucca also has been used in soaps, shampoos, and food supplements. Yuccas contain saponins that have a long-lasting soaping action. A solid extract is derived from the leaves; the Mohave yucca is the most common commercially used plant. Current commercial uses of yucca extracts include foaming agents in carbonated beverages, flavorings, and for use in drug synthesis research."
258,Zinc,"
